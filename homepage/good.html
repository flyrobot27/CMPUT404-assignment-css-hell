    Note:

     Jessica Hope, Samuel Chuff and any company names mentioned in this assignment are PURELY FICTIONAL. 
     A Better Tomorrow (tm) is simply a random name I thought of for a sketchy, shady investment bank / shell company. 
     IT IS PURELY COINCIDENCE IF SUCH NAME OR COMPANY DO EXISTS.
