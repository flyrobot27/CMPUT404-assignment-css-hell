<p class="tei tei-p c6">Although this little work, and its fellow, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c18">Rollo At Play</span></span>,”</span>
 are intended principally as a means of entertainment for their little 
readers, it is hoped by the writer that they may aid in accomplishing 
some of the following useful purposes:—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">1. In cultivating <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">the thinking powers</span></span>;
 as frequent occasions occur, in which the incidents of the narrative, 
and the conversations arising from them, are intended to awaken and 
engage the reasoning and reflective faculties of the little readers.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">2. In promoting the progress of children <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">in reading</span></span>
 and in knowledge of language; for the diction of the stories is 
intended to be often in advance of the natural language of the reader, 
and yet so used as to be explained by the connection.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">3. In cultivating the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">amiable and gentle qualities of the heart</span></span>.
 The scenes are laid in quiet and virtuous life, and the character and 
conduct described are generally—with the exception of some of the 
ordinary exhibitions of childish folly—character and conduct to be 
imitated; for it is generally better, in dealing with children, to 
allure them to what is right by agreeable pictures of it, than to 
attempt to drive them to it by repulsive delineations of what is wrong.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Elky.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">When Rollo was between five and six years old, 
he was one day at work in his little garden, planting some beans. His 
father had given him a little square bed in a corner of the garden, 
which he had planted with corn two days before. He watched his corn 
impatiently for two days, and, as it did not come up, he thought he 
would plant it again with beans. He ought to have waited longer.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He was sitting on a little cricket, digging 
holes in the ground, when he heard a sudden noise. He started up, and 
saw a strange, monstrous head looking at him over the garden wall. He 
jumped up, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page8">[pg 8]</span>and ran as fast as he could towards the house.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">It happened that Jonas, the boy, was at that time at work in the yard, cutting wood, and he called out, <span class="tei tei-q">“What is the matter, Rollo?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo had just looked round, and seeing that the
 head remained still where it was, he was a little ashamed of his fears;
 so at first he did not answer, but walked along towards Jonas.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“That's the colt,”</span> said Jonas; <span class="tei tei-q">“should not you like to go and see him?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo looked round again, and true enough, it 
was a small horse's head that was over the wall. It looked smaller now 
than it did when he first saw it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Now there was behind the garden a green field, 
with scattered trees upon it, and a thick wood at the farther side. 
Jonas took Rollo by the hand, and led him back into the garden, towards 
the colt. The colt took his head back over the fence as they approached,
 and walked away. He was now afraid of Rollo. Jonas and Rollo climbed up
 upon a stile which was built there against the fence, and saw the colt 
trotting away slowly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page9">[pg 9]</span>down
 towards the wood, looking back at Rollo and Jonas, by bending his head 
every minute, first on one side, and then on the other.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“There comes father,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Jonas looked and saw Rollo's father coming out 
of the wood, leading a horse. The colt and the horse had been feeding 
together in the field, and Rollo's father had caught the horse, for he 
wanted to take a ride. Rollo's father had a little basket in his hand, 
and when he saw the colt coming towards him, he held it up and called 
him, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Elky, Elky, Elky, Elky</span></span>,”</span>
 for the colt's name was Elkin, though they often called him Elky. Elkin
 walked slowly up to the basket, and put his nose in it. He found that 
there were some oats in it; and Rollo's father poured them out on the 
grass, and then stood by, patting Elky's head and neck while he ate 
them. Rollo thought his head looked beautifully; he wondered how he 
could have been afraid of it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo's father led the horse across the field, through a gate, into a green lane <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page10">[pg 10]</span>which
 led along the side of the garden towards the house; and Rollo said he 
would run round into the lane and meet him. So he jumped off of the 
stile, and ran up the garden, and Jonas followed him, and went back to 
his work.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo ran round to meet his father, who was coming up the green lane, leading the horse with a rope round his neck.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Father,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“could you put me on?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">His father smiled, and lifted Rollo up carefully, and placed him on the horse's back. Then he walked slowly along.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Father,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“are you going away?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am going to ride away in the wagon.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why did not you catch Elky, and let him draw you?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Elky? O, Elky is not old enough to work.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not old enough to work!”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“Why, he is pretty big. He is almost as big as the horse. I should think he could draw you alone in the wagon.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Perhaps he is strong enough for that; but Elky has never learned to work yet.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page11">[pg 11]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“Never learned!”</span> said Rollo, in great surprise. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do horses have to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">learn</span></span> to work? Why, they have nothing to do but to pull.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, suppose,”</span> said his father, <span class="tei tei-q">“that he should dart off at once as soon as he is harnessed, and pull with all his strength, and furiously.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, he must not do so: he must pull gently and slowly.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, suppose he pulls 
gently a minute, and then stops and looks round, and then I tell him to 
go on, and he pulls a minute again, and then stops and looks round.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O no,”</span> said Rollo, laughing, <span class="tei tei-q">“he must not do so; he must keep pulling steadily all the time.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, so you see he has 
something more to do than merely to pull; he must pull right, and he 
must be taught to do this. Besides, he must learn to obey all my various
 commands. Why, a horse needs to be taught to work as much as a boy.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, father, I can work; and I have never been taught.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O no,”</span> said his father, smiling, <span class="tei tei-q">“you cannot work.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page12">[pg 12]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“I can plant beans,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Just then, Rollo, who was all this time riding 
on the horse, looked down from his high seat into a little bush by the 
side of the road, and saw there a little bunch that looked like a 
birdsnest; and he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“O, father, please to take me down; I want to look at that birdsnest.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">His father knew that he would not hurt the 
birdsnest; so he took him off of the horse, and put him on the ground. 
Then he walked on with the horse, and Rollo turned back to see the nest.
 He climbed up upon a log that lay by the side of the bush, and then 
gently opened the branches and looked in. Four little, unfledged birds 
lifted up their heads, and opened their mouths wide. They heard the 
noise which Rollo made, and thought it was their mother come to feed 
them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, you little dickeys,”</span> said Rollo; <span class="tei tei-q">“hungry, are you? <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">I</span></span> have not got any thing for you to eat.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo looked at them a little while, and then slowly got down and walked along up the lane, saying to himself, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">They</span></span> are not big enough to work, at any rate, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">I</span></span> am, I know, and I do not believe but that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Elky</span></span> is.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-div c23">
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page13">[pg 13]</span> <a id="toc6"></a> <a id="pdf7"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Preparations.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">When Rollo got back into the yard, he found his 
father just getting into the wagon to go away. Jonas stood by the horse,
 having just finished harnessing him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Father,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“I can work. You thought I could not work, but I can. I am going to work to-day while you are gone.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Are you?”</span> said his father. <span class="tei tei-q">“Very well; I should be glad to have you.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What should you like to have me do?”</span> asked Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, you may pick up chips, or pile that short wood in the shed. But stand back from the wheel, for I am going to start now.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So Rollo stood back, and his father drew up the 
reins which Jonas had just put into his hands, and guided the horse 
slowly and carefully out of the yard. Rollo ran along behind the wagon 
as far as the gate, to see his father go off, and stood there a few 
minutes, watching him as he rode along, until he disappeared at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page14">[pg 14]</span>a
 turn in the road. He then came back to the yard, and sat down on a log 
by the side of Jonas, who was busily at work mending the wheelbarrow.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo sat singing to himself for some time, and then he said,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Jonas, father thinks I am not big enough to work; don't you think I am?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don't know,”</span> said Jonas, hesitating. <span class="tei tei-q">“You do not seem to be very industrious just now.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, I am resting now,”</span> said Rollo; <span class="tei tei-q">“I am going to work pretty soon.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What are you resting from?”</span> said Jonas.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, I am resting because I am tired.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What are you tired of?”</span> said Jonas. <span class="tei tei-q">“What have you been doing?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo had no answer at hand, for he had not been
 doing any thing at all. The truth was, it was pleasanter for him to sit
 on the log and sing, and see Jonas mend the wheelbarrow, than to go to 
work himself; and he mistook that feeling for being tired. Boys often do
 so when they are set to work.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo, finding that he had no excuse for sitting there any longer, presently got up, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg 15]</span>and sauntered along towards the house, saying that he was going to work, picking up chips.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Now there was, in a certain corner of the yard, a
 considerable space covered with chips, which were the ones that Rollo 
had to pick up. He knew that his father wished to have them put into a 
kind of a bin in the shed, called the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">chip-bin</span></span>. So he went into the house for a basket.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He found his mother busy; and she said she could
 not go and get a basket for him; but she told him the chip-basket was 
probably in its place in the shed, and he might go and get that.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“that is too large. I cannot lift that great basket full of chips.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“You need not fill it full then,”</span> said his mother. <span class="tei tei-q">“Put in just as many as you can easily carry.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo still objected, saying that he wanted her very much to go and get a smaller one. He could not work without a smaller one.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Very well,”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“I would rather that you should not work then. The in<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg 16]</span>terruption
 to me to get up now, and go to look for a smaller basket, will be 
greater than all the good you will do in picking up chips.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo then told her that his father wanted him 
to work, and he related to her all the conversation they had had. She 
then thought that she had better do all in her power to give Rollo a 
fair experiment; so she left her work, went down, got him a basket which
 he said was just big enough, and left him at the door, going out to his
 work in the yard.</p>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-div c23">
<a id="toc8"></a> <a id="pdf9"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">A Bad Beginning.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo sat down on the chips, and began picking 
them up, all around him, and throwing them into his basket. He soon 
filled it up, and then lugged it in, emptied it into the chip-bin, and 
then returned, and began to fill it again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He had not got his basket more than half full 
the second time, before he came upon some very large chips, which were 
so square and flat, that he thought they would be good to build houses 
with. He <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page17">[pg 17]</span>thought he 
would just try them a little, and began to stand them up in such a 
manner as to make the four walls of a house. He found, however, an 
unexpected difficulty; for although the chips were large and square, yet
 the edges were so sharp that they would not stand up very well.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Some time was spent in trying experiments with 
them in various ways; but he could not succeed very well; so he began 
again industriously to put them into his basket.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">When he got the basket nearly full, the second 
time, he thought he was tired, and that it would be a good plan to take a
 little time for rest; and he would go and see Jonas a little while.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Now his various interruptions and delays, his 
conversation with his mother, the delay in getting the basket, and his 
house-building, had occupied considerable time; so that, when he went 
back to Jonas, it was full half an hour from the time when he left him; 
and he found that Jonas had finished mending the wheelbarrow, and had 
put it in its place, and was just going away himself into the field.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page18">[pg 18]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, Rollo,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“how do you get along with your work?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, very well,”</span> said Rollo; <span class="tei tei-q">“I have been picking up chips all the time since I went away from you.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo did not mean to tell a falsehood. But he was not aware how much of his time he had idled away.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“And how many have you got in?”</span> said Jonas.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Guess,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Six baskets full,”</span> said Jonas.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Eight.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No; not so many.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“How many, then?”</span> said Jonas, who began to be tired of guessing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Two; that is, I have got one in, and the other is almost full.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Only two?”</span> said Jonas. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then you cannot have worked very steadily. Come here and I will show you how to work.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-div c23">
<a id="toc10"></a> <a id="pdf11"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">What Rollo Might Do.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So Jonas walked along to the chips, and asked Rollo to fill up that basket, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page19">[pg 19]</span>carry it, and then come back, and he would tell him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So Rollo filled up the basket, carried it to the
 bin, and came back very soon. Jonas told him then to fill it up again 
as full as it was before.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“There,”</span> said Jonas, when it was done, <span class="tei tei-q">“now
 it is as full as the other was, and I should think you have been less 
than two minutes in doing it. We will call it two minutes. Two minutes 
for each basket full would make thirty baskets full in an hour. Now, I 
don't think there are more than thirty baskets full in all; so that, if 
you work steadily, but without hurrying any, you would get them all in 
in an hour.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“In an hour?”</span> said Rollo. <span class="tei tei-q">“Could I get them all in in an hour?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said Jonas, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have no doubt you can. But you must not hurry and get tired out. Work moderately, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">steadily</span></span>;—that is the way.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So Jonas went to the field, leaving Rollo to go 
on with his thirty baskets. Rollo thought it would be a fine thing to 
get the chips all in before his father should come home, and he went to 
work very busily filling his basket the third time.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg 20]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“I can do it quicker,”</span> said he to himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“I can fill the basket a great deal faster than that. I will get it all done in half an hour.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So he began to throw in the chips as fast as 
possible, taking up very large ones too, and tossing them in in any way.
 Now it happened that he did fill it this time very quick; for the 
basket being small, and the chips that he now selected very large, they 
did not pack well, but lay up in every direction, so as apparently to 
fill up the basket quite full, when, in fact, there were great empty 
spaces in it; and when he took it up to carry it, it felt very light, 
because it was in great part empty.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He ran along with it, forgetting Jonas's advice 
not to hurry, and thinking that the reason why it seemed so light was 
because he was so strong. When he got to the coal-bin, the chips would 
not come out easily. They were so large that they had got wedged between
 the sides of the basket, and he had hard work to get them out.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">This fretted him, and cooled his ardor somewhat; he walked back rather slowly, and began again to fill his basket.</p>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-div c23">
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page21">[pg 21]</span> <a id="toc12"></a> <a id="pdf13"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">A New Plan.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Before he had got many chips in it, however, he 
happened to think that the wheelbarrow would be a better thing to get 
them in with. They would not stick in that as they did in the basket. <span class="tei tei-q">“Men always use a wheelbarrow,”</span> he said to himself, <span class="tei tei-q">“and why should not I?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So he turned the chips out of his basket, thus 
losing so much labor, and went after the wheelbarrow. He spent some time
 in looking to see how Jonas had mended it, and then he attempted to 
wheel it along to the chips. He found it quite heavy; but he contrived 
to get it along, and after losing considerable time in various delays, 
he at last had it fairly on the ground, and began to fill it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He found that the chips would go into the 
wheelbarrow beautifully, and he was quite pleased with his own ingenuity
 in thinking of it. He thought he would take a noble load, and so he 
filled it almost full, but it took a long time to do it, for the 
wheelbarrow was so large that he got tired, and stopped several times to
 rest.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span>When,
 at length, it was full, he took hold of the handles, and lifted away 
upon it. He found it very heavy. He made another desperate effort, and 
succeeded in raising it from the ground a little; but unluckily, as 
wheelbarrows are very apt to do when the load is too heavy for the 
workman, it tipped down to one side, and, though Rollo exerted all his 
strength to save it, it was in vain.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><a id="figlist14"></a></p>
<div class="tei tei-figure c14">
<img src="The%20Project%20Gutenberg%20EBook%20of%20Rollo%20at%20Work%20by%20Jacob%20Abbott_files/i025.jpg" alt="Too Heavy." title="Too Heavy." width="480" height="480">
<div class="tei tei-head c13">Too Heavy.</div>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page23">[pg 23]</span>Over went the wheelbarrow, and about half of the chips were poured out upon the ground again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O dear me!”</span> said Rollo; <span class="tei tei-q">“I wish this wheelbarrow was not so heavy.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He sat down on the side of the wheelbarrow for a
 time in despair. He had a great mind to give up work for that day. He 
thought he had done enough; he was tired. But, then, when he reflected 
that he had only got in three small baskets of chips, and that his 
father would see that it was really true, as he had supposed, that Rollo
 could not work, he felt a little ashamed to stop.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So he tipped the wheelbarrow back, which he 
could easily do now that the load was half out, and thought he would 
wheel those along, and take the rest next time.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">By great exertions he contrived to stagger along
 a little way with this load, until presently the wheel settled into a 
little low place in the path, and he could not move it any farther. This
 worried and troubled him again. He tried to draw the wheelbarrow back, 
as he had often seen Jonas do in similar cases, but in vain. It would 
not move back or forwards. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page24">[pg 24]</span>Then he went round to the wheel, and pulled upon that; but it would not do. The wheel held its place immovably.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo sat down on the grass a minute or two, 
wishing that he had not touched the wheelbarrow. It was unwise for him 
to have left his basket, his regular and proper mode of carrying the 
chips, to try experiments with the wheelbarrow, which he was not at all 
accustomed to. And now the proper course for him to have taken, would 
have been to leave the wheelbarrow where it was, go and get the basket, 
take out the chips from the wheelbarrow, and carry them, a basket full 
at a time, to the bin, then take the wheelbarrow to its place, and go on
 with his work in the way he began.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">But Rollo, like all other boys who have not 
learned to work, was more inclined to get somebody to help him do what 
was beyond his own strength, than to go quietly on alone in doing what 
he himself was able to do. So he left the wheelbarrow, and went into the
 house to try to find somebody to help him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He came first into the kitchen, where Mary was at work getting dinner, and he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page25">[pg 25]</span>asked
 her to come out and help him get his wheelbarrow out of a hole. Mary 
said she could not come then, but, if he would wait a few minutes, she 
would. Rollo could not wait, but went off in pursuit of his mother.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mother,”</span> said he, as he opened the door into her chamber, <span class="tei tei-q">“could not you come out and help me get my wheelbarrow along?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What wheelbarrow?”</span> said his mother.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, the great wheelbarrow. I am wheeling chips in it, and I cannot get it along.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I thought you were picking up chips in the basket I got for you.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, mother, I did a little while; but I thought I could get them along faster with the wheelbarrow.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“And, instead of that, it seems you cannot get them along at all.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, mother, it is only
 one little place. It is in a little hole. If I could only get it out of
 that little hole, it would go very well.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But it seems to me you are not a very profitable workman, Rollo, after all. You wanted me very much to go and get you <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page26">[pg 26]</span>a
 small basket, because the common basket was too large and heavy; so I 
left my work, and went and got it for you. But you soon lay it aside, 
and go, of your own accord, and get something heavier than the common 
chip-basket, a great deal. And now I must leave my work and go down and 
wheel it along for you.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Only this once, mother. If you can get it out of this hole for me, I will be careful not to let it get in again.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> said his mother at length, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
 will go. Though the common way with wagoners, when they get their loads
 into difficulty, is to throw a part off until they lighten it 
sufficiently, and then go on. I will go this time; but if you get into 
difficulty again, you must get out yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So Rollo and his mother went down together, and 
she took hold of the wheelbarrow, and soon got it out. She advised Rollo
 not to use the wheelbarrow, but to return to his basket, but yet wished
 him to do just as he thought best himself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">When she had returned to the house, Rollo went 
on with his load, slowly and with great difficulty. He succeeded, 
however, in working it along until he came to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span>the
 edge of the platform which was before the shed door, where he was to 
carry in his chips. Here, of course, he was at a complete stand, as he 
could not get the wheel up such a high step; so he sat down on the edge 
of the platform, not knowing what to do next.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He could not go to his mother, for she had told 
him that she could not help him again; so, on the whole, he concluded 
that he would not pick up chips any more; he would pile the wood. He 
recollected that his father had told him that he might either pick up 
chips or pile wood; and the last, he thought, would be much easier.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I shall not have any thing to carry or to wheel at all,”</span> said he to himself, <span class="tei tei-q">“and so I shall not have any of these difficulties.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So he left his wheelbarrow where it was, at the 
edge of the platform, intending to ask Jonas to get it up for him when 
he should come home. He went into the shed, and began to pile up the 
wood.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">It was some very short, small wood, prepared for
 a stove in his mother's chamber, and he knew where his father wanted to
 have it piled—back against the side of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg 28]</span>the shed, near where the wood was lying Jonas had thrown it down there in a heap as he had sawed and split it.</p>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-div c23">
<a id="toc15"></a> <a id="pdf16"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Hirrup! Hirrup!</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He began to lay the wood regularly upon the 
ground where his pile was to be, and for a few minutes went on very 
prosperously. But presently he heard a great trampling in the street, 
and ran out to see what it was, and found that it was a large herd of 
cattle driving by—oxen and cows, and large and small calves. They filled
 the whole road as they walked slowly along, and Rollo climbed up upon 
the fence, by the side of the gate, to look at them. He was much amused 
to see so large a herd, and he watched all their motions. Some stopped 
to eat by the road side; some tried to run off down the lane, but were 
driven back by boys with long whips, who ran after them. Others would 
stand still in the middle of the road and bellow, and here and there two
 or three would be seen pushing one another with their horns, or running
 up upon a bank by the road side.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page29">[pg 29]</span>Presently
 Rollo heard a commotion among the cattle at a little distance, and, 
looking that way, saw that Jonas was in among them, with a stick, 
driving the about, and calling out, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c18">Hirrup! Hirrup!</span></span>
 At first he could not think what he was doing; but presently he saw 
that their own cow had got in among the others, and Jonas was trying to 
get her out.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Some of the men who were driving the herd helped
 him, and they succeeded, at length, in getting her away by herself, by 
the side of the road. The rest of the cattle moved slowly on, and when 
they were fairly by, Jonas called out to Rollo to open the gate and then
 run away.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo did, accordingly, open the gate and run up the yard, and presently he saw the cow coming in, with Jonas after her.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Jonas,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“how came our cow in among all those?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“She got out of the pasture somehow,”</span> said Jonas, in reply, <span class="tei tei-q">“and I must go and drive her back. How do you get along with your chips?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, not very well. I want you to help me get the wheelbarrow up on the platform.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page30">[pg 30]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“The wheelbarrow!”</span> said Jonas. <span class="tei tei-q">“Are you doing it with the wheelbarrow?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No. I am not picking up chips now at all. I am piling wood. I <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">did</span></span> have the wheelbarrow.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">In the mean time, the cow walked along through 
the yard and out of the gate into the field, and Jonas said he must go 
on immediately after her, to drive her back into the pasture, and put up
 the fence, and so he could not stop to help Rollo about the chips; but 
he would just look in and see if he was piling the wood right.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He accordingly just stepped a moment to the shed door, and looked at Rollo's work. <span class="tei tei-q">“That will do very well,”</span> said he; <span class="tei tei-q">“only you must put the biggest ends of the sticks outwards, or it will all tumble down.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So saying, he turned away, and walked off fast after the cow.</p>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-div c23">
<a id="toc17"></a> <a id="pdf18"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">An Overturn.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo stood looking at him for some time, wishing that he was going too. But <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page31">[pg 31]</span>he
 knew that he must not go without his mother's leave, and that, if he 
should go in to ask her, Jonas would have gone so far that he should not
 be able to overtake him. So he went back to his wood-pile.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He piled a little more, and as he piled he 
wondered what Jonas meant by telling him to put the largest ends 
outwards. He took up a stick which had a knot on one end, which made 
that end much the largest, and laid it on both ways, first with the knot
 back against the side of the shed, and then with the knot in front, 
towards himself. He did not see but that the stick lay as steadily in 
one position as in the other.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Jonas was mistaken,”</span> said he. <span class="tei tei-q">“It
 is a great deal better to put the big ends back. Then they are out of 
sight; all the old knots are hid, and the pile looks handsomer in 
front.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So he went on, putting the sticks upon the pile 
with the biggest ends back against the shed. By this means the back side
 of the pile began soon to be the highest, and the wood slanted forward,
 so that, when it was up nearly as high as his head, it leaned forward 
so as to be quite<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page32">[pg 32]</span> 
unsteady. Rollo could not imagine what made his pile act so. He thought 
he would put on one stick more, and then leave it. But, as he was 
putting on this stick, he found that the whole pile was very unsteady. 
He put his hand upon it, and shook it a little, to see if it was going 
to fall, when he found it was coming down right upon him, and had just 
time to spring back before it fell.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He did not get clear, however; for, as he 
stepped suddenly back, he tumbled over the wood which was lying on the 
ground, and fell over backwards; and a large part of the pile came down 
upon him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He screamed out with fright and pain, for he 
bruised himself a little in falling; though the wood which fell upon him
 was so small and light that it did not do much serious injury.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo stopped crying pretty soon, and went into 
the house; and that evening, when his father came home, he went to him, 
and said,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Father, you were right, after all; I <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">don't</span></span> know how to work any better than Elky.”</span></p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Rides.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo often used to ride out with his father and
 mother. When he was quite a small boy, he did not know how to manage so
 as to get frequent rides. He used to keep talking, himself, a great 
deal, and interrupting his father and mother, when they wanted to talk; 
and if he was tired, he would complain, and ask them, again and again, 
when they should get home. Then he was often thirsty, and would tease 
his father and mother for water, in places where there was no water to 
be got, and then fret because he was obliged to wait a little while. In 
consequence of this, his father and mother did not take him very often. 
When they wanted a quiet, still, pleasant ride, they had to leave Rollo 
behind. A great many <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span>children act just as Rollo did, and thus deprive themselves of a great many very pleasant rides.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo observed, however, that his uncle almost 
always took Lucy with him when he went to ride. And one day, when he was
 playing in the yard where Jonas was at work setting out trees, he saw 
his uncle riding by, with another person in the chaise, and Lucy sitting
 between them on a little low seat. Lucy smiled and nodded as she went 
by; and when she had gone, Rollo said,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“There goes Lucy, taking
 a ride. Uncle almost always takes her, when he goes any where. I wonder
 why father does not take me as often.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I know why,”</span> said Jonas.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What is the reason?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Because you are 
troublesome, and Lucy is not. If I was a boy like you, I should manage 
so as almost always to ride with my father.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, what should you do?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, in the first place, I should never find fault with my seat. I should sit exactly where they put me, without any com<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page37">[pg 37]</span>plaint. Then I should not talk much, and I should <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">never</span></span>
 interrupt them when they were talking. If I saw any thing on the road 
that I wanted to ask about, I should wait until I had a good opportunity
 to do it without disturbing their conversation; and then, if I wanted 
any thing to eat or drink, I should not ask for it, unless I was in a 
place where they could easily get it for me. Thus I should not be any 
trouble to them, and so they would let me go almost always.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo was silent. He began to recollect how much
 trouble he had given his parents, when riding with them, without 
thinking of it at the time. He did not say any thing to Jonas about it, 
but he secretly resolved to try Jonas's experiment the very next time he
 went to ride.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He did so, and in a very short time his father 
and mother both perceived that there was, some how or other, a great 
change in his manners. He had ceased to be troublesome, and had become 
quite a pleasant travelling companion. And the effect was exactly as 
Jonas had foretold. His father and mother liked very much to have such a
 still, pleasant little boy sitting <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg 38]</span>between them; and at last they began almost to think they could not have a pleasant ride themselves, unless Rollo was with them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">They used to put a little cricket in, upon the 
bottom of the chaise, for Rollo to sit upon; but this was not very 
convenient, and so one day Rollo's father said that, now Rollo had 
become so pleasant a boy to ride with them, he would have a little seat 
made on purpose for him. <span class="tei tei-q">“In fact,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will take the chaise down to the corporal's to-night, and see if he cannot do it for me.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“And may I go with you?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said his father, <span class="tei tei-q">“you may.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo was always very much pleased when his father let him go to the corporal's.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">The Corporal's.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">But perhaps the reader will like to know who 
this corporal was that Rollo was so desirous of going to see. He was an 
old soldier, who had become disabled in the wars, so that he could not 
go out to do very hard work, but was very ingenious <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page39">[pg 39]</span>in making and mending things, and he had a little shop down by the mill, where he used to work.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo often went there with Jonas, to carry a 
chair to be mended, or to get a lock or latch put in order; and 
sometimes to buy a basket, or a rake, or some simple thing that the 
corporal knew how to make. A corporal, you must know, is a kind of an 
officer in a company. This man had been such an officer; and so they 
always called him the corporal. I never knew what his other name was.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">That evening Rollo and his father set off in the
 chaise to go to the corporal's. It was not very far. They rode along by
 some very pleasant farm-houses, and came at length to the house where 
Georgie lived. They then went down the hill; but, just before they came 
to the bridge, they turned off among the trees, into a secluded road, 
which led along the bank of the stream. After going on a short distance,
 they came out into a kind of opening among the trees, where a mill came
 into view, by the side of the stream; and opposite to it, across the 
road, under the trees, was the corporal's little shop.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg 40]</span>The
 trees hung over the shop, and behind it there was a high rocky hill 
almost covered with forest trees. Between the shop and the mill they 
could see the road winding along a little way still farther up the 
stream, until it was lost in the woods.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><a id="figlist25"></a></p>

<div class="tei tei-head c13">The Corporal's</div>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">As soon as Rollo came in sight of the shop, he saw a little wheelbarrow standing up by the side of the door. It was just <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page41">[pg 41]</span>large enough for him, and he called out for his father to look at it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is a very pretty little wheelbarrow,”</span> said his father.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wish you would buy it for me. How much do you suppose the corporal asks for it?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“We will talk with him about it,”</span> said his father.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So saying, they drove up to the side of the road
 near the mill, and fastened the horse at a post. Then Rollo clambered 
down out of the chaise, and he and his father walked into the shop.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">They found the corporal busily at work mending a
 chair-bottom. Rollo stood by, much pleased to see him weave in the 
flags, while his father explained to the corporal that he wanted a small
 seat made in front, in his chaise.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I do not know whether you can do it, or not,”</span> said he.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What sort of a seat do you want?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I thought,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
 you might make a little seat, with two legs to it in front, and then 
fasten the back side of it to the front of the chaise-box.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said the corporal, <span class="tei tei-q">“that will do <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page42">[pg 42]</span>I
 think; but I must have a little blacksmith work to fasten the seat 
properly behind, so that you can slip it out when you are not using it. 
Let us go and see.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So the corporal rose to go out and see the 
chaise, and as they passed by the wheelbarrow at the door, as they went 
out, Rollo asked him what was the price of that little wheelbarrow.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“That is not for sale, 
my little man. That is engaged. But I can make you one, if your father 
likes. I ask three quarters of a dollar for them.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo looked at it very wishfully, and the corporal told him that he might try it if he chose. <span class="tei tei-q">“Wheel it about,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“while your father and I are looking at the chaise.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So Rollo trundled the wheelbarrow up and down 
the road with great pleasure. It was light, and it moved easily. He 
wished he had such a one. It would not tip over, he said, like that 
great heavy one at home; he thought he could wheel it even if it was 
full of stones. He ran down with it to the shore of the stream, where 
there were plenty of stones lying, intending to load it up, and try it. 
But <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page43">[pg 43]</span>when he got 
there, he recollected that he had not had liberty to put any thing in 
it; and so he determined at once that he would not.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Just then his father called him. So he wheeled 
the wheelbarrow back to its place, and told the corporal that he liked 
it very much. He wanted his father to engage one for him then, but he 
did not ask him. He thought that, as he had already expressed a wish for
 one, it would be better not to say any thing about it again, but to 
wait and let his father do as he pleased.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">As they were going home, his father said,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“That was a very pretty wheelbarrow, Rollo, I think myself.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, it was beautiful, father. It was so light, and went so easy! I wish you would buy me one, father.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I would, my son, but I think a wheelbarrow will give you more pleasure at some future time, than it will now.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“When do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“When you have learned to work.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But I want the wheelbarrow to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">play</span></span> with.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page44">[pg 44]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“I
 know you do; but you would take a great deal more solid and permanent 
satisfaction in such a thing, if you were to use it for doing some 
useful work.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“When shall I learn to work, father?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I have been thinking that it is full time now. You are about six years old, and they say that a boy of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">seven</span></span> years old is able to earn his living.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, father, I wish you would teach me to work. What should you do first?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“The first lesson would be to teach you to do some common, easy work, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">steadily</span></span>.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, father, I can do that now, without being taught.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I think you are 
mistaken about that. A boy works steadily when he goes directly forward 
in his work, without stopping to rest, or to contrive new ways of doing 
it, or to see other people, or to talk. Now, do you think you could work
 steadily an hour, without stopping for any of these reasons?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why—yes,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I will try you to-morrow,”</span> said his father.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">The Old Nails.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The next morning, after breakfast, Rollo's 
father told him he was ready for him to go to his work. He took a small 
basket in his hand, and led Rollo out into the barn, and told him to 
wait there a few minutes, and he would bring him something to do.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo sat down on a little bundle of straw, wondering what his work was going to be.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Presently his father came back, bringing in his 
hands a box full of old nails, which he got out of an old store-room, in
 a corner of the barn. He brought it along, and set it down on the barn 
floor.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, father,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“what am I going to do with those old nails?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“You are going to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">sort</span></span>
 them. Here are a great many kinds, all together. I want them all picked
 over—those that are alike put by themselves. I will tell you exactly 
how to do it.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo put his hand into the box, and began to pick up some of the nails, and look them over, while his father was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page46">[pg 46]</span>speaking; but his father told him to put them down, and not begin until he had got all his directions.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“You must listen,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“and understand the directions now, for I cannot tell you twice.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He then took a little wisp of straw, and brushed away a clean place upon the barn floor, and then poured down the nails upon it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, how many nails!”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">His father then took up a handful of them, and 
showed Rollo that there were several different sizes; and he placed them
 down upon the floor in little heaps, each size by itself. Those that 
were crooked also he laid away in a separate pile.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, Rollo,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
 want you to go to work sorting these nails, steadily and industriously,
 until they are all done. There are not more than three or four kinds of
 nails, and you can do them pretty fast if you work <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">steadily</span></span>,
 and do not get to playing with them. If you find any pieces of iron, or
 any thing else that you do not know what to do with, lay them aside, 
and go on with the nails. Do you understand it all?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg 47]</span>Rollo
 said he did, and so his father left him, and went into the house. Rollo
 sat down upon the clean barn floor, and began his task.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don't think this is any great thing,”</span> said he; <span class="tei tei-q">“I can do this easily enough;”</span> and he took up some of the nails, and began to arrange them as his father had directed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">But Rollo did not perceive what the real 
difficulty in his task was. It was, indeed, very easy to see what nails 
were large, and what were small, and what were of middle size, and to 
put them in their proper heaps. There was nothing very hard in that. The
 difficulty was, that, after having sorted a few, it would become 
tedious and tiresome work, doing it there all alone in the barn,—picking
 out old nails, with nobody to help him, and nobody to talk to, and 
nothing to see, but those little heaps of rusty iron on the floor.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">This, I say, was the real trouble; and Rollo's 
father knew, when he set his little boy about it, that he would soon get
 very tired of it, and, not being accustomed to any thing but play, 
would not persevere.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page48">[pg 48]</span>And
 so it was. Rollo sorted out a few, and then he began to think that it 
was rather tiresome to be there all alone; and he thought it would be a 
good plan for him to go and ask his father to let him go and get his 
cousin James to come and help him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He accordingly laid down the nails he had in his hand, and went into the house, and found his father writing at a table.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What is the matter now?”</span> said his father.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, father,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
 thought I should like to have James come and help me, if you are 
willing;—we can get them done so much quicker if there are two.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But my great object is,
 not to get the nails sorted very quick, but to teach you patient 
industry. I know it is tiresome for you to be alone, but that is the 
very reason why I wish you to be alone. I want you to learn to persevere
 patiently in doing any thing, even if it is tiresome. What I want to 
teach you is, to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">work</span></span>, not to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">play</span></span>.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo felt disappointed, but he saw that his 
father was right, and he went slowly back to his task. He sorted out two
 or three handfuls more, but he found there <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page49">[pg 49]</span>was no pleasure in it, and he began to be very sorry his father had set him at it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Having no heart for his work, he did not go on 
with alacrity, and of course made very slow progress. He ought to have 
gone rapidly forward, and not thought any thing about the pleasantness 
or unpleasantness of it, but only been anxious to finish the work, and 
please his father. Instead of that, he only lounged over it—looked at 
the heap of nails, and sighed to think how large it was. He could not 
sort all those, possibly, he said. He knew he could not. It would take 
him forever.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Still he could not think of any excuse for 
leaving his work again, until, after a little while, he came upon a 
couple of screws. <span class="tei tei-q">“And now what shall I do with these?”</span> said he.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He took the screws, and laid them side by side, 
to measure them, so as to see which was the largest. Then he rolled them
 about a little, and after playing with them for a little time, during 
which, of course, his work was entirely neglected, he concluded he would
 go and ask his father what he was to do with screws.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page50">[pg 50]</span>He
 accordingly walked slowly along to the house, stopping to look at the 
grasshoppers and butterflies by the way. After wasting some time in this
 manner, he appeared again at his father's table, and wanted to know 
what he should do with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">screws</span></span> that he found among the nails.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“You ought not to have left your work to come and ask that question,”</span> said his father. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am afraid you are not doing very well. I gave you all the necessary instructions. Go back to your work.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But, father,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“as he went out, I do not know what I am to do with the screws. You did not say any thing about screws.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then why do you leave your work to ask me any thing about them?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why,—because,—”</span> said Rollo, hesitating. He did not know what to say.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Your work is to sort out the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">nails</span></span>, and I expect, by your coming to me for such frivolous reasons, that you are not going on with it very well.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo went slowly out of the room, and sauntered
 along back to his work. He put the screws aside, and went on with the 
nails, but he did very little. When the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page51">[pg 51]</span>heart is not in the work, it always goes on very slowly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Thus an hour or two of the forenoon passed away,
 and Rollo made very little progress. At last his father came out to see
 what he had done; and it was very plain that he had been idling away 
his time, and had accomplished very little indeed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">His father then said that he might leave his work and come in. Rollo walked along by the side of his father, and he said to him—</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I see, Rollo, that I shall not succeed in teaching you to work industriously, without something more than kind words.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo knew not what to say, and so he was silent. He felt guilty and ashamed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I gave you work to do 
which was very easy and plain, but you have been leaving it repeatedly 
for frivolous reasons; and even while you were over your work, you have 
not been industrious. Thus you have wasted your morning entirely; you 
have neither done work nor enjoyed play.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I was afraid it would be so,”</span> he continued. <span class="tei tei-q">“Very few boys can be taught to work industriously, without being com<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page52">[pg 52]</span>pelled;
 though I hoped that my little Rollo could have been. But as it is, as I
 find that persuasion will not do, I must do something more decided. I 
should do very wrong to let you grow up an idle boy; and it is time for 
you to begin to learn to do something besides play.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He said this in a kind, but very serious tone, 
and it was plain he was much displeased. He told Rollo, a minute or two 
after, that he might go, then, where he pleased, and that he would 
consider what he should do, and tell him some other time.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">A Conversation.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">That evening, when Rollo was just going to bed, his father took him up in his lap, and told him he had concluded what to do.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“You see it is very necessary,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
 you should have the power of confining yourself steadily and patiently 
to a single employment, even if it does not amuse you. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">I</span></span> have to do that, and all people have to do it, and you must learn <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page53">[pg 53]</span>to
 do it, or you will grow up indolent and useless. You cannot do it now, 
it is very plain. If I set you to doing any thing, you go on as long as 
the novelty and the amusement last, and then your patience is gone, and 
you contrive every possible excuse for getting away from your task. Now,
 I am going to give you one hour's work to do, every forenoon and 
afternoon. I shall give you such things to do, as are perfectly plain 
and easy, so that you will have no excuse for neglecting your work or 
leaving it. But yet I shall choose such things as will afford you no 
amusement; for I want you to learn to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">work</span></span>, not play.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But, father,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“you
 told me there was pleasure in work, the other day. But how can there be
 any pleasure in it, if you choose such things as have no amusement in 
them, at all?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“The pleasure of working,”</span> said his father, <span class="tei tei-q">“is
 not the fun of doing amusing things, but the satisfaction and solid 
happiness of being faithful in duty, and accomplishing some useful 
purpose. For example, if I were to lose my pocket-book on the road, and 
should tell you to walk back a mile, and look carefully all the way <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg 54]</span>until
 you found it, and if you did it faithfully and carefully, you would 
find a kind of satisfaction in doing it; and when you found the 
pocket-book, and brought it back to me, you would enjoy a high degree of
 happiness. Should not you?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, yes, sir, I should,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“And yet there would be no <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">amusement</span></span>
 in it. You might, perhaps, the next day, go over the same road, 
catching butterflies: that would be amusement. Now, the pleasure you 
would enjoy in looking for the pocket-book, would be the solid 
satisfaction of useful work. The pleasure of catching butterflies would 
be the amusement of play. Now, the difficulty is, with you, that you 
have scarcely any idea, yet, of the first. You are all the time looking 
for the other, that is, the amusement. You begin to work when I give you
 any thing to do, but if you do not find <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">amusement</span></span>
 in it, you soon give it up. But if you would only persevere, you would 
find, at length, a solid satisfaction, that would be worth a great deal 
more.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo sat still, and listened, but his father saw, from his looks, that he was not much interested in what he was say<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page55">[pg 55]</span>ing; and he perceived that it was not at all probable that so small a boy could be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">reasoned</span></span>
 into liking work. In fact, it was rather hard for Rollo to understand 
all that his father said,—and still harder for him to feel the force of 
it. He began to grow sleepy, and so his father let him go to bed.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Rollo Learns to Work at Last.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The next day his father gave him his work. He 
was to begin at ten o'clock, and work till eleven, gathering beans in 
the garden. His father went out with him, and waited to see how long it 
took him to gather half a pint, and then calculated how many he could 
gather in an hour, if he was industrious. Rollo knew that if he failed 
now, he should be punished in some way, although his father did not say 
any thing about punishment. When he was set at work the day before, 
about the nails, he was making an experiment, as it were, and he did not
 expect to be actually punished if he failed; but now he knew that he 
was under orders, and must obey.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page56">[pg 56]</span>So
 he worked very diligently, and when his father came out at the end of 
the hour, he found that Rollo had got rather more beans than he had 
expected. Rollo was much gratified to see his father pleased; and he 
carried in his large basket full of beans to show his mother, with great
 pleasure. Then he went to play, and enjoyed himself very highly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The next morning, his father said to him,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, Rollo, you did 
very well yesterday; but doing right once is a very different thing from
 forming a habit of doing right. I can hardly expect you will succeed as
 well to-day; or, if you should to-day, that you will to-morrow.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo thought he should. His work was to pick up
 all the loose stones in the road, and carry them, in a basket, to a 
great heap of stones behind the barn. But he was not quite faithful. His
 father observed him playing several times. He did not speak to him, 
however, until the hour was over, and then he called him in.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Rollo,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“you have failed to-day. You have not been very idle, but have not been industrious; and the pun<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page57">[pg 57]</span>ishment which I have concluded to try first, is, to give you only bread and water for dinner.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So, when dinner time came, and the family sat 
down to the good beefsteak and apple-pie which was upon the table, Rollo
 knew that he was not to come. He felt very unhappy, but he did not cry.
 His father called him, and cut off a good slice of bread, and put into 
his hands, and told him he might go and eat it on the steps of the back 
door. <span class="tei tei-q">“If you should be thirsty,”</span> he added, <span class="tei tei-q">“you may ask Mary to give you some water.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo took the bread, and went out, and took his
 solitary seat on the stone step leading into the back yard, and, in 
spite of all his efforts to prevent it, the tears would come into his 
eyes. He thought of his guilt in disobeying his father, and he felt 
unhappy to think that his father and mother were seated together at 
their pleasant table, and that he could not come because he had been an 
undutiful son. He determined that he would never be unfaithful in his 
work again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He went on, after this, several days, very well. His father gave him various <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page58">[pg 58]</span>kinds
 of work to do, and he began at last to find a considerable degree of 
satisfaction in doing it. He found, particularly, that he enjoyed 
himself a great deal more after his work than before, and whenever he 
saw what he had done, it gave him pleasure. After he had picked up the 
loose stones before the house, for instance, he drove his hoop about 
there, with unusual satisfaction; enjoying the neat and tidy appearance 
of the road much more than he would have done if Jonas had cleared it. 
In fact, in the course of a month, Rollo became quite a faithful and 
efficient little workman.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">The Corporal's Again.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now,”</span> said his father to him one day, after he had been doing a fine job of wood-piling,—<span class="tei tei-q">“now we will go and talk with the corporal about a wheelbarrow. Or do you think you could find the way yourself?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo said he thought he could.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Very well, you may go; I believe I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page59">[pg 59]</span>shall let you have a wheelbarrow now, and you can ask him how soon he can have it done.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo clapped his hands, and capered about, and asked his father how long he thought it would be before he could have it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, you will learn,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“when you come to talk with the corporal.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you think it will be a week?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I think it probable that he could make one in less than a week,”</span> said his father, smiling.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, how soon?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, I cannot tell you: wait till you get to his shop, and then you will see.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo saw that, for some reason or other, his 
father was not inclined to talk about the time when he should have his 
wheelbarrow, but he could not think why; however, he determined to get 
the corporal to make it as quick as he could, at any rate.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">It was about the middle of the afternoon that 
Rollo set off to go for his wheelbarrow. His mother told him he might go
 and get his cousin James to go with him if he chose. So he walked along
 towards <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page60">[pg 60]</span>the bridge, 
and, instead of turning at once off there to go towards the mill, he 
went on over the bridge towards the house where James lived. James came 
with him, and they walked back very pleasantly together.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">When they got back across the bridge again, they
 turned off towards the mill, talking about the wheelbarrow. Rollo told 
James about his learning to work, and about his having seen the 
wheelbarrow at the corporal's, and how he trundled it about, and liked 
it very much.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I should like to see it very much,”</span> said James. <span class="tei tei-q">“I suppose I can, when we get to the corporal's shop.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“he said that that wheelbarrow was engaged; and I suppose it has been taken away before this time.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Just then the corner of the corporal's shop 
began to corner into view, and presently the door came in sight, and 
James called out,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, yes, there it is. I see it standing up by the side of the door.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“that is not it. That is a green one.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page61">[pg 61]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“What color was the wheelbarrow that you saw?”</span> asked James.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“It was not any color; it was not painted,”</span> said Rollo. <span class="tei tei-q">“I wonder whose that wheelbarrow can be?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The boys walked along, and presently came to the door of the shop. They opened the door, and went in. There was nobody there.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Various articles were around the room. There was
 a bench at one side, near a window; and there were a great many tools 
upon it, and upon shelves over it. On another side of the shop was a 
lathe, a curious sort of a machine, that the corporal used a great deal,
 in some of his nicest work. Then there were a good many things there, 
which were sent in to be mended, such as chairs, a spinning-wheel, boys'
 sleds, and one or two large wheelbarrows.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The boys walked around the room a few minutes, 
looking at the various things; and at last Rollo spied another little 
wheelbarrow, on a shelf. It was very much like the one at the door, only
 it was painted green.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo said that that one looked exactly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page62">[pg 62]</span>like the one he trundled when he was there before, only it was green.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Perhaps he has painted it since,”</span> said James; <span class="tei tei-q">“let us go to the door, and look at the other one, and see which is the biggest.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So they went to the door, and found that the blue one was a little the biggest.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Just then they saw the corporal coming across 
the road, with a hatchet in his hand. He had been to grind it at the 
mill, where there was a grindstone, that went round by water.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, boys,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“how do you do? Have you come for your wheelbarrow, Rollo.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir,”</span> said Rollo; <span class="tei tei-q">“how soon can you get it done?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Done? it is done now,”</span> said he; <span class="tei tei-q">“there it is.”</span> And he took the blue wheelbarrow, which was at the door, and set it down in the path.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“That is not mine,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“is it?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said the corporal; <span class="tei tei-q">“your father spoke for it a week ago.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo took hold of his wheelbarrow, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page63">[pg 63]</span>and began to wheel it along. He liked it very much.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><a id="figlist34"></a></p>

<div class="tei tei-head c13">Rollo Took Hold of His Wheelbarrow.</div>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">James said he wished he could have one too, and 
while Rollo was talking with the corporal, he could not help looking at 
the green one on the shelf, which he thought was just about as big as he
 should like.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The corporal asked him if he wanted to see that 
one, and he took it down for him. James took hold of the handles, and 
tried it a little, back and forth on the floor, and then he said it was 
just about big enough for him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who is this for?”</span> said he to the corporal.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I do not know,”</span> said the corporal; <span class="tei tei-q">“a gentleman bespoke it some time ago. I do not know what his name is.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Just then he seemed to see somebody out of the window.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ah! here he comes now!”</span> he exclaimed suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Just then the door opened, and whom should the boys see coming in, but their uncle George!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, James,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“have you got hold of your wheelbarrow already?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page64">[pg 64]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">My</span></span> wheelbarrow!”</span> said James. <span class="tei tei-q">“Is this mine?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said his uncle, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
 got it made to give to you. But when I found that Rollo was having one 
made, I waited for his to be done, so that you might have them both 
together. So trundle them home.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So the boys set off on the run down the road, in fine style, with their wheelbarrows trundling beautifully before them.</p>

<a id="toc37"></a> <a id="pdf38"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Sand-Men.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Next to little wooden blocks, I think that good,
 clean sand is an excellent thing for children to play with. When it is a
 little damp, it will remain in any shape you put it in, and you can 
build houses and cities, and make roads and canals in it. At any rate, 
Rollo and his cousin James used to be very fond of going down to a 
certain place in the brook, where there was plenty of sand, and playing 
in it. It was of a gray color, and somewhat mixed with pebble-stones; 
but then they used to like the pebble-stones very much to make walls 
with, and to stone up the little wells which they made in the sand.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">One Wednesday afternoon, they were there playing very pleasantly with the sand. They had been building a famous <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page68">[pg 68]</span>city,
 and, after amusing themselves with it some time, they had knocked down 
the houses, and trampled the sand all about again. James then said he 
meant to go to the barn and get his horse-cart, and haul a load of sand 
to market.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Now there was a place around behind a large rock
 near there, which the boys called their barn; and Rollo and James went 
to it, and pulled out their two little wheelbarrows, which they called 
their horse-carts. They wheeled them down to the edge of the water, and 
began to take up the sand by double handfuls, and put it in.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">When they had got their carts loaded, they began to wheel them around to the trees, and stones, and bushes, saying,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who'll buy my sand?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who'll buy my white sand?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who'll buy my gray sand?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who'll buy my black sand?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">But they did not seem to find any purchaser; and at last Rollo said, suddenly,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, I know who will buy our sand.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who?”</span> said James.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mother.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“So she will,”</span> said James. <span class="tei tei-q">“We will wheel it up to the house.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page69">[pg 69]</span>So
 they set off, and began wheeling their loads of sand up the pathway 
among the trees. They went on a little way, and presently stopped, and 
sat down on a bank to rest. Here they found a number of flowers, which 
they gathered and stuck up in the sand, so that their loads soon made a 
very gay appearance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Just as they were going to set out again, Rollo said,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But, James, how are we going to get through the quagmire?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O,”</span> said James, <span class="tei tei-q">“we can step along on the bank by the side of the path.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said Rollo; <span class="tei tei-q">“for we cannot get our wheelbarrows along there.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, yes,—we got them along there when we came down.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But they were empty and light then; now they are loaded and heavy.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“So they are; but I think we can get along; it is not very muddy there now.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The place which the boys called the quagmire, 
was a low place in the pathway, where it was almost always muddy. This 
pathway was made by the cows, going up and down to drink; and it was a 
good, dry, and hard path in all places <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page70">[pg 70]</span>but
 one. This, in the spring of the year, was very wet and miry; and, 
during the whole summer, it was seldom perfectly dry. The boys called it
 the quagmire, and they used to get by on one side, in among the bushes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">They found that it was not very muddy at this 
time, and they contrived to get through with their loads of sand, and 
soon got to the house. They trundled their wheelbarrows up to the door 
leading out to the garden; and Rollo knocked at the door.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Now Rollo's mother happened, at this time, to be
 sitting at the back-parlor window, and she heard their voices as they 
came along the yard. So, supposing the knocking was some of their play, 
she just looked out of the window, and called out,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who's there?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Some sand-men,”</span> Rollo answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“who have got some sand to sell.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">His mother looked out of the window, and had 
quite a talk with them about their sand; she asked them where it came 
from, what color it was, and whether it was free from pebble-stones. The
 boys had to admit that there were a good many <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page71">[pg 71]</span>pebble-stones in it, and that pebble-stones were not very good to scour floors with.</p>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-div c23">
<a id="toc39"></a> <a id="pdf40"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">The Gray Garden.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">At last, Rollo's mother recommended that they 
should carry the sand out to a corner of the yard, where the chips used 
to be, and spread it out there, and stick their flowers up in it for a 
garden.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The boys liked this plan very much. <span class="tei tei-q">“We can make walks and beds, beautifully, in the sand,”</span> said Rollo. <span class="tei tei-q">“But, mother, do you think the flowers will grow?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said his mother, <span class="tei tei-q">“flowers
 will not grow in sand; but, as it is rather a shady place, and you can 
water them occasionally, they will keep green and bright a good many 
days, and then, you know, you can get some more.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So the boys wheeled the sand out to the corner 
of the yard, took the flowers out carefully, and then tipped the sand 
down and spread it out. They tried to make walks and beds, but they 
found <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg 72]</span>they had not got as much sand as they wanted. So they concluded to go back and get some more.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">In fact, they found that, by getting a great 
many wheelbarrow loads of sand, they could cover over the whole corner, 
and make a noble large place for a sand-garden. And then, besides, as 
James said, when they were tired of it for a garden, they could build 
cities there, instead of having to go away down to the brook.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So they went on wheeling their loads of sand, 
for an hour or two. James had not learned to work as well as Rollo had, 
and he was constantly wanting to stop, and run into the woods, or play 
in the water; but Rollo told him it would be better to get all the sand 
up, first. They at last got quite a great heap, and then went and got a 
rake and hoe to level it down smooth.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Thus the afternoon passed away; and at last Mary
 told the boys that they must come and get ready for tea, for she was 
going to carry it in soon.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page73">[pg 73]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-div c23">
<a id="toc41"></a> <a id="pdf42"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">A Contract.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So Rollo and James brushed the loose sand from 
their clothes, and washed their faces and hands, and went in. As tea was
 not quite ready, they sat down on the front-door steps before Rollo's 
father, who was then sitting in his arm-chair in the entry, reading.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He shut up the book, and began to talk with the boys.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, boys,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“what have you been doing all this afternoon?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“we have been hard at work.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“And what have you been doing?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo explained to his father that they had been
 making a sand-garden out in a corner of the yard, and they both asked 
him to go with them and see it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">They all three accordingly went out behind the house, the children running on before.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But, boys,”</span> said Rollo's father, as they went on, <span class="tei tei-q">“how came your feet so muddy?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O,”</span> said James, <span class="tei tei-q">“they got muddy in the quagmire.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page74">[pg 74]</span>The
 boys explained how they could not go around the quagmire with their 
loaded wheelbarrows, and so had to pick their way through it the best 
way they could; and thus they got their shoes muddy a little; but they 
said they were as careful as they could be.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">When they came to the sand-garden, Rollo's 
father smiled to see the beds and walks, and the rows of flowers stuck 
up in the sand. It made quite a gay appearance. After looking at it some
 time, they went slowly back again, and as they were walking across the 
yard,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Father,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“do you not think that is a pretty good garden?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, yes,”</span> said his father, <span class="tei tei-q">“pretty good.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don't you think we have worked pretty well?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, I think I should call that play, not work.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not work!”</span> said Rollo. <span class="tei tei-q">“Is it not work to wheel up such heavy loads of sand? You don't know how heavy they were.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I dare say it was hard; but boys <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">play</span></span> hard, sometimes, as well as work hard.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page75">[pg 75]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“But I should think ours, this afternoon, was work,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Work,”</span> replied his father, <span class="tei tei-q">“is
 when you are engaged in doing any thing in order to produce some useful
 result. When you are doing any thing only for the amusement of it, 
without any useful result, it is play. Still, in one sense, your 
wheeling the sand was work. But it was not very useful work; you will 
admit that.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, boys, how should you like to do some useful work for me, with your wheelbarrows? I will hire you.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, we should like that very much,”</span> said James. <span class="tei tei-q">“How much should you pay us?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“That would depend upon 
how much work you do. I should pay you what the work was fairly worth; 
as much as I should have to pay a man, if I were to hire a man to do 
it.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What should you give us to do?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don't know. I should think of some job. How should you like to fill up the quagmire?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Fill up the quagmire!”</span> said Rollo. <span class="tei tei-q">“How could we do that?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page76">[pg 76]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“You
 might fill it up with stones. There are a great many small stones lying
 around there, which you might pick up and put into your wheelbarrows, 
and wheel them along, and tip them over into the quagmire; and when you 
have filled the path all up with stones, cover them over with gravel, 
and it will make a good causey.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Causey?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, causey,”</span> said his father; <span class="tei tei-q">“such a hard, dry road, built along a muddy place, is called a causey.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">They had got to the tea-table by this time; and 
while at tea, Rollo's father explained the plan to them more fully. He 
said he would pay them a cent for every two loads of stones or gravel 
which they should wheel in to make the causey.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">They were going to ask some more questions about
 it, but he told them he could not talk any more about it then, but that
 they might go and ask Jonas how they should do it, after tea.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Instructions.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">They went out into the kitchen, after tea, to 
find Jonas; but he was not there. They then went out into the yard; and 
presently James saw him over beyond the fence, walking along the lane. 
Rollo called out,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Jonas! Jonas! where are you going?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am going after the cows.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“We want you!”</span> said Rollo, calling out loud.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What for?”</span> said Jonas.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“We want to talk with you about something.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Just then, Rollo's mother, hearing this hallooing, looked out of the window, and told the boys they must not make so much noise.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, we want Jonas,”</span> said Rollo; <span class="tei tei-q">“and he has gone to get the cows.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, you may go with him,”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“if you wish; and you can talk on the way.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So the boys took their hats and ran, and soon came to where Jonas was: for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg 78]</span>he had been standing still, waiting for them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">They walked along together, and the boys told 
Jonas what their father had said. Jonas said he should be very glad to 
have the quagmire filled up, but he was afraid it would not do any good 
for him to give them any directions.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why?”</span> said James.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Because,”</span> said Jonas, <span class="tei tei-q">“little boys will never follow any directions. They always want to do the work their own way.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, but we <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">will</span></span> obey the directions,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you remember about the wood-pile?”</span> said Jonas.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo hung his head, and looked a little ashamed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What was it about the wood-pile?”</span> said James.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, I told Rollo,”</span> said Jonas, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
 he ought to pile wood with the big ends in front, but he did not mind 
it; he thought it was better to have the big ends back, out of sight; 
and that made the pile lean forward; and presently it all fell over upon
 him.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page79">[pg 79]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“Did it?”</span> said James. <span class="tei tei-q">“Did it hurt you much, Rollo?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, not much. But we will follow the directions now, Jonas, if you will tell us what to do.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Very well,”</span> said Jonas, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will try you.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“In the first place, you
 must get a few old pieces of board, and lay them along the quagmire to 
step upon, so as not to get your feet muddy. Then you must go and get a 
load of stones, in each wheelbarrow, and wheel them along. You must not 
tip them down at the beginning of the muddy place, for then they will be
 in your way when you come with the next load.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“You must go on with 
them, one of you right behind the other, both stepping carefully on the 
boards, till you get to the farther end, and there tip them over both 
together. Then you must turn round yourselves, but not turn your 
wheelbarrows round. You must face the other way, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">draw</span></span> your wheelbarrows out.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why?”</span> said James.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Because,”</span> said Jonas, <span class="tei tei-q">“it would be difficult to turn your wheelbarrows round <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page80">[pg 80]</span>there among the mud and stones, but you can draw them out very easily.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then, besides, you must
 not attempt to go by one another. You must both stop at the same time, 
but as near one another as you can, and go out just as you came in; that
 is, if Rollo came in first, and James after him, James must come up as 
near to Rollo as he can, and then, when the loads are tipped over, and 
you both turn round, James will be before Rollo, and will draw his 
wheelbarrow out first. Do you understand?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said James.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Must we always go in together?”</span> asked Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, that is better.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Because, if you go in 
at different times, you will be in one another's way. One will be going 
out when the other is coming in, and so you will interfere with one 
another. Then, besides, if you fill the wheelbarrows together, and wheel
 together, you will always be in company,—which is pleasanter.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, we will,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“After you have wheeled one load <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page81">[pg 81]</span>apiece
 in, you must go and get another, and wheel that in as far as you can. 
Tip them over on the top of the others, if you can, or as near as you 
can. Each time you will not go in quite so far as before, so that at 
last you will have covered the quagmire all over with stones once.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“And then must we put on the gravel?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O no. That will not be 
stones enough. They would sink down into the mud, and the water would 
come up over them. So you must wheel on more.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But how can we?”</span> said James. <span class="tei tei-q">“We cannot wheel on the top of all those stones.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said Jonas; <span class="tei tei-q">“so
 you must go up to the house and get a pretty long, narrow board, as 
long as you and Rollo can carry, and bring it down and lay it along on 
the top of the stones. Perhaps you will have to move the stones a 
little, so as to make it steady; and then you can wheel on that. If one 
board is not long enough, you must go and get two. And you must put them
 down on one side of the path, so that the stones will go into the 
middle of the path and upon the other side, so as not to cover up the 
board.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then, when you have put loads of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page82">[pg 82]</span>stones
 all along in this way, you must shift your boards over to the other 
side of the path, and then wheel on them again; and that will fill up 
the side where the boards lay at first. And so, after a while, you will 
get the whole pathway filled up with stones, as high as you please. I 
should think you had better fill it up nearly level with the bank on 
each side.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">By this time the boys came to the bars that led 
into the pasture, and they went in and began to look about for the cows.
 Jonas did not see them any where near, and so he told the boys that 
they might stay there and pick some blackberries, while he went on and 
found them. He said he thought that they must be out by the boiling 
spring.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">This boiling spring, as they called it, was a 
beautiful spring, from which fine cool water was always boiling up out 
of the sand. It was in a narrow glen, shaded by trees, and the water 
running down into a little sort of meadow, kept the grass green there, 
even in very dry times; so that the cows were very fond of this spot.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">James and Rollo remained, according to Jonas's proposal, near the bars, while he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page83">[pg 83]</span>went
 along the path towards the spring. Rollo and James had a fine time 
gathering blackberries, until, at last, they saw the cows coming, lowing
 along the path. Presently they saw Jonas's head among the bushes.</p>

<div class="tei tei-head c13">The Cows.</div>

<p class="tei tei-p c6">When he came up to the boys, he told them it was lucky that they did not <span class="tei tei-corr">go</span> with him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page84">[pg 84]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“Why?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I came upon an enormous hornet's nest, and you would very probably have got stung.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Where was it?”</span> said James.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, it was right over the path, just before you get to the spring.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The boys said they were very sorry to hear that,
 for now they could not go to the spring any more; but Jonas said he 
meant to destroy the nest.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“How shall you destroy it?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I shall burn it up.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But how can you?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Jonas then explained to them how he was going to
 burn the hornet's nest. He said he should take a long pole with two 
prongs at one end like a pitchfork, and with that fork up a bunch of 
hay. Then he should set the top of the hay on fire, and stand it up 
directly under the nest.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The boys continued talking about the hornet's 
nest all the way home, and forgot to say any thing more about the causey
 until just as they were going into the yard. Then they told Jonas that 
he had not told them how to put on the gravel, on the top.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg 85]</span>He said he could not tell them then, and, besides, they would have as much as they could do to put in stones for one day.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Besides, James said it was sundown, and time for
 him to go home; but he promised to come the next morning, if his mother
 would let him, as soon as he had finished his lessons.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Keeping Tally.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo and James began their work the next day 
about the middle of the forenoon, determined to obey Jonas's directions 
exactly, and to work industriously for an hour. They put a number of 
small pieces of board upon their wheelbarrows, to put along the pathway 
at first, and just as they had got them placed, Jonas came down just to 
see whether they were beginning right.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He saw them wheel in one or two loads of stones, and told them he thought they were doing very well.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“We have earned one cent already,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page86">[pg 86]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“How,”</span> said Jonas; <span class="tei tei-q">“is your father going to pay you for your work?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“a cent for every two loads we put in.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then you must keep tally,”</span> said Jonas.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Tally</span></span>,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“what is tally?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Tally is the reckoning. How are you going to remember how many loads you wheel in?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, we can remember easily enough,”</span> said Rollo: <span class="tei tei-q">“we will count them as we go along.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“That will never do,”</span> said Jonas. <span class="tei tei-q">“You must mark them down with a piece of chalk on your wheelbarrow.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So saying, Jonas fumbled in his pockets, and 
drew out a small, well-worn piece of chalk, and then tipped up Rollo's 
wheelbarrow, saying,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“How many loads do you say you have carried already?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Two,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Two,”</span> repeated Jonas; and he made two white marks with his chalk on the side of the wheelbarrow.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“There!”</span> said he.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mark mine,”</span> said James; <span class="tei tei-q">“I have wheeled two loads.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page87">[pg 87]</span>Jonas
 marked them, and then laid the chalk down upon a flat stone by the side
 of the path, and told the boys that they must stop after every load, 
and make a mark, and that would keep the reckoning exact.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Jonas then left them, and the boys went on with 
their work. They wheeled ten loads of stones apiece, and by that time 
had the bottom of the path all covered, so that they could not wheel any
 more, without the long boards. They went up and got the boards, and 
laid them down as Jonas had described, and then went on with their 
wheeling.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">At first, James kept constantly stopping, either
 to play, or to hear Rollo talk; for they kept the wheelbarrows together
 all the time, as Jonas had recommended. At such times, Rollo would 
remind him of his work, for he had himself learned to work steadily. 
They were getting on very finely, when, at length, they heard a bell 
ringing at the house.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">This bell was to call them home; for as Rollo and Jonas were often away at a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page88">[pg 88]</span>little
 distance from the house, too far to be called very easily, there was a 
bell to ring to call them home; and Mary, the girl, had two ways of 
ringing it—one way for Jonas, and another for Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The bell was rung now for Rollo; and so he and 
James walked along towards home. When they had got about half way, they 
saw Rollo's father standing at the door, with a basket in his hand; and 
he called out to them to bring their wheelbarrows.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So the boys went back for their wheelbarrows.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">When they came up a second time with their wheelbarrows before them, he asked how they had got along with their work.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, famously,”</span> said Rollo. <span class="tei tei-q">“There is the tally,”</span> said he, turning up the side of the wheelbarrow towards his father, so that he could see all the marks.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, have you wheeled as many loads as that?”</span> said his father.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“and James just as many too.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“And were they all good loads?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, all good, full loads.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page89">[pg 89]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, you have done very well. Count them, and see how many there are.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The boys counted them, and found there were fifteen.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“That is enough to come to seven cents, and one load over,”</span>
 said Rollo's father; and he took out his purse, and gave the boys seven
 cents each, that is, a six-cent piece in silver, and one cent besides. 
He told them they might keep the money until they had finished their 
work, and then he would tell them about purchasing something with it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“you
 can rub out the tally—all but one mark. I have paid you for fourteen 
loads, and you have wheeled in fifteen; so you have one mark to go to 
the new tally. You can go round to the shed, and find a wet cloth, and 
wipe out your marks clean, and then make one again, and leave it there 
for to-morrow.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But we are going right back now,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said his father; <span class="tei tei-q">“I don't want you to do any more to-day.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why not, father? We want to, very much.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page90">[pg 90]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“I
 cannot tell you why, now; but I choose you should not. And, now, here 
is a luncheon for you in this basket. You may go and eat it where you 
please.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-div c23">
<a id="toc48"></a> <a id="pdf49"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Rights Defined.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So the boys took the basket, and, after they had
 rubbed out the tally, they went and sat down by their sand-garden, and 
began to eat the bread and cheese very happily together.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">After they had finished their luncheon, they 
went and got a watering-pot, and began to water their sand-garden, and, 
while doing it, began to talk about what they should buy with their 
money. They talked of several things that they should like, and, at 
last, Rollo said he meant to buy a bow and arrow with his.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“A bow and arrow?”</span> said James. <span class="tei tei-q">“I do not believe your father will let you.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, he will let me,”</span> said Rollo. <span class="tei tei-q">“Besides, it is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">our</span></span> money, and we can do what we have a mind to with it.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don't believe that,”</span> said James.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page91">[pg 91]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, yes, we can,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don't believe we can,”</span> said James.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I mean to go and ask my father,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“this minute.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So he laid down the watering-pot, and ran in, 
and James after him. When they got into the room where his father was, 
they came and stood by his side a minute, waiting for him to be ready to
 speak to them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Presently, his father laid down his pen, and said,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What, my boys!”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is not this money our own?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“And can we not buy what we have a mind to with it?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“That depends upon what you have a mind to buy.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But, father, I should think that, if it was our own, we might do <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">any thing</span></span> with it we please.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said his father, <span class="tei tei-q">“that does not follow, at all.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, father,”</span> said Rollo, looking disappointed, <span class="tei tei-q">“I thought every body could <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page92">[pg 92]</span>do what they pleased with their own things.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Whose hat is that you have on? Is it James's?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, sir, it is mine.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Are you sure it is your own?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, yes, sir,”</span> said Rollo, taking off his hat and looking at it, and wondering what his father could mean.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, do you suppose you have a right to go and sell it?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, sir,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Or go and burn it up?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Or give it away?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then it seems that people cannot always do what they please with their own things.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, father, it seems to me, that is a very different thing.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I dare say it seems so to you; but it is not—it is just the same thing. No person can do <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">anything they please</span></span> with their property. There are limits and restrictions in all cases. And in all cases where children have property, whether it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page93">[pg 93]</span>is money, hats, toys, or any thing, they are always limited and restricted to such a use of them <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">as their parents approve</span></span>.
 So, when I give you money, it becomes yours just as your clothes, or 
your wheelbarrow, or your books, are yours. They are all yours to use 
and to enjoy; but in the way of using them and enjoying them, you must 
be under my direction. Do you understand that?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, yes, sir,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“And does it not appear reasonable?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir, I don't know but it is reasonable. But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">men</span></span> can do anything they please with their money, can they not?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said his father; <span class="tei tei-q">“they
 are under various restrictions made by the laws of the land. But I 
cannot talk any more about it now. When you have finished your work, I 
will talk with you about expending your money.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The boys went on with their work the next day, 
and built the causey up high enough with stones. They then levelled them
 off, and began to wheel on the gravel. Jonas made each of them a little
 shovel out of a shingle; and, as the gravel was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page94">[pg 94]</span>lying
 loose under a high bank, they could shovel it up easily, and fill their
 wheelbarrows. The third day they covered the stones entirely with 
gravel, and smoothed it all over with a rake and hoe, and, after it had 
become well trodden, it made a beautiful, hard causey; so that now there
 was a firm and dry road all the way from the house to the 
watering-place at the brook.</p>

<div class="tei tei-div c23">

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Calculation.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">On counting up the loads which it had taken to 
do this work, Rollo's father found that he owed Rollo twenty-three 
cents, and James twenty-one. The reason why Rollo had earned the most 
was because, at one time, James said he was tired, and must rest, and, 
while he was resting, Rollo went on wheeling.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">James seemed rather sorry that he had not got as many cents as Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wish I had not stopped to rest,”</span> said he.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wish so too,”</span> said Rollo; <span class="tei tei-q">“but I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page95">[pg 95]</span>will give you two of my cents, and then I shall have only twenty-one, like you.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Shall we be alike then?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said Rollo; <span class="tei tei-q">“for, you see, two cents taken away from twenty-three, leaves twenty-one, which is just as many as you have.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, but then I shall have more. If you give me two, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">I</span></span> shall have twenty-three.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“So you will,”</span> said Rollo; <span class="tei tei-q">“I did not think of that.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The boys paused at this unexpected difficulty; 
at last, Rollo said he might give his two cents back to his father, and 
then they should have both alike.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Just then the boys heard some one calling,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Rollo!”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo looked up, and saw his mother at the chamber window. She was sitting there at work, and had heard their conversation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What, mother?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“You might give him <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">one</span></span> of yours, and then you will both have twenty-two.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">They thought that this would be a fine <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page96">[pg 96]</span>plan,
 and wondered why they had not thought of it before. A few days 
afterwards, they decided to buy two little shovels with their money, one
 for each, so that they might shovel sand and gravel easier than with 
the wooden shovels that Jonas made.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Farmer Cropwell.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">One warm morning, early in the spring, just 
after the snow was melted off from the ground, Rollo and his father went
 to take a walk. The ground by the side of the road was dry and settled,
 and they walked along very pleasantly; and at length they came to a 
fine-looking farm. The house was not very large, but there were great 
sheds and barns, and spacious yards, and high wood-piles, and flocks of 
geese, and hens and turkeys, and cattle and sheep, sunning themselves 
around the barns.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo and his father walked into the yard, and 
went up to the end door, a large pig running away with a grunt when they
 came up. The door was open, and Rollo's father knocked at it with the 
head of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span>his cane. A pleasant-looking young woman came to the door.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is Farmer Cropwell at home?”</span> said Rollo's father.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir,”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“he is out in the long barn, I believe.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Shall I go there and look for him?”</span> said he.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“If you please, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So Rollo's father walked along to the barn.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">It was a long barn indeed. Rollo thought he had 
never seen so large a building. On each side was a long range of stalls 
for cattle, facing towards the middle, and great scaffolds overhead, 
partly filled with hay and with bundles of straw. They walked down the 
barn floor, and in one place Rollo passed a large bull chained by the 
nose in one of the stalls. The bull uttered a sort of low growl or roar,
 as Rollo and his father passed, which made him a little afraid; but his
 attention was soon attracted to some hens, a little farther along, 
which were standing on the edge of the scaffolding over his head, and 
cackling with noise enough to fill the whole barn.</p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span>When
 they got to the other end of the barn, they found a door leading out 
into a shed; and there was Farmer Cropwell, with one of his men and a 
pretty large boy, getting out some ploughs.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Good morning, Mr. Cropwell,”</span> said Rollo's father; <span class="tei tei-q">“what! are you going to ploughing?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, it is about time to overhaul the ploughs, and see that they are in order. I think we shall have an early season.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, I find my garden is getting settled, and I came to talk with you a little about some garden seeds.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The truth was, that Rollo's father was 
accustomed to come every spring, and purchase his garden seeds at this 
farm; and so, after a few minutes, they went into the house, taking 
Rollo with them, to get the seeds that were wanted, out of the 
seed-room.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">What they called the seed-room was a large 
closet in the house, with shelves all around it; and Rollo waited there a
 little while, until the seeds were selected, put up in papers, and 
given to his father.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">When this was all done, and they were just coming out, the farmer said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span>my little boy, you have been very still and patient. Should not you like some seeds too? Have you got any garden?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, sir,”</span> said Rollo; <span class="tei tei-q">“but perhaps my father will give me some ground for one.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I will give you a few seeds, at any rate.”</span>
 So he opened a little drawer, and took out some seeds, and put them in a
 piece of paper, and wrote something on the outside. Then he did so 
again and again, until he had four little papers, which he handed to 
Rollo, and told him to plant them in his garden.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo thanked him, and took his seeds, and they returned home.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Work and Play.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">On the way, Rollo thought it would be an excellent plan for him to have a garden, and he told his father so.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I think it would be an excellent plan myself,”</span> said his father. <span class="tei tei-q">“But do you intend to make work or play of it?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, I must make work of it, must not I, if I have a real garden?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said his father; <span class="tei tei-q">“you may make play of it if you choose.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“How?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, you can take a 
hoe, and hoe about in the ground as long as it amuses you to hoe; and 
then you can plant your seeds, and water and weed them just as long as 
you find any amusement in it. Then, if you have any thing else to play 
with, you can neglect your garden a long time, and let the weeds grow, 
and not come and pull them up until you get tired of other play, and 
happen to feel like working in your garden.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I should not think that that would be a very good plan,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, yes,”</span> replied his father; <span class="tei tei-q">“I do not know but that it is a good plan enough,—that is, for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">play</span></span>.
 It is right for you to play sometimes; and I do not know why you might 
not play with a piece of ground, and seeds, as well as with any thing 
else.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, father, how should I manage my garden if I was going to make <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">work</span></span> of it?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, then you would not do it for amusement, but for the useful results.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span> You would consider what you could raise to best advantage, and then lay out your garden; not as you might happen to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">fancy</span></span>
 doing it, but so as to get the most produce from it. When you come to 
dig it over, you would not consider how long you could find amusement in
 digging, but how much digging is necessary to make the ground 
productive; and so in all your operations.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, father, which do you think would be the best plan for me?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, I hardly know. By 
making play of it, you will have the greatest pleasure as you go along. 
But, in the other plan, you will have some good crops of vegetables, 
fruits, and flowers.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“And shouldn't I have any crops if I made play of my garden?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes; I think you might, perhaps, have some flowers, and, perhaps, some beans and peas.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo hesitated for some time which plan he 
should adopt. He had worked enough to know that it was often very 
tiresome to keep on with his work when he wanted to go and play; but 
then he knew that after it was over, there was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span>great satisfaction in thinking of useful employment, and in seeing what had been done.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">That afternoon he went out into the garden to 
consider what he should do, and he found his father there, staking out 
some ground.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Father,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“whereabouts should you give me the ground for my garden?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, that depends,”</span> said his father, <span class="tei tei-q">“on
 the plan you determine upon. If you are going to make play of it, I 
must give you ground in a back corner, where the irregularity, and the 
weeds, will be out of sight. But if you conclude to have a real garden, 
and to work industriously a little while every day upon it, I should 
give it to you there, just beyond the pear-tree.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo looked at the two places, but he could not
 make up his mind. That evening he asked Jonas about it, and Jonas 
advised him to ask his father to let him have both. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“you
 can work on your real garden as long as there is any necessary work to 
be done, and then you could go and play about the other with James or 
Lucy, when they are here.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span>Rollo
 went off immediately, and asked his father. His father said there would
 be some difficulties about that; but he would think of it, and see if 
there was any way to avoid them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The next morning, when he came in to breakfast, 
he had a paper in his hand, and he told Rollo he had concluded to let 
him have the two gardens, on certain conditions, which he had written 
down. He opened the paper, and read as follows:—</p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr class="c15">
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Conditions on which I let Rollo have two pieces of land to cultivate</span></span>; the one to be called his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">working-garden</span></span>, and the other his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">playing-garden</span></span>.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“1. In cultivating his working-garden, he is to take Jonas's advice, and to follow it faithfully in every respect.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“2. He is not to go and 
work upon his playing-garden, at any time, when there is any work that 
ought to be done on his working-garden.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“3. If he lets his 
working-garden get out of order, and I give him notice of it; then, if 
it is not put perfectly in order again within three days after receiving
 the notice, he is to forfeit the garden, and all that is growing upon 
it.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“4. Whatever he raises, he may sell to me, at fair prices, at the end of the season.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-div c23">
<a id="toc59"></a> <a id="pdf60"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Planting.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo accepted the conditions, and asked his 
father to stake out the two pieces of ground for him, as soon as he 
could; and his father did so that day. The piece for the working-garden 
was much the largest. There was a row of currant-bushes near it, and his
 father said he might consider all those opposite his piece of ground as
 included in it, and belonging to him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So Rollo asked Jonas what he had better do 
first, and Jonas told him that the first thing was to dig his ground all
 over, pretty deep; and, as it was difficult to begin it, Jonas said he 
would begin it for him. So Jonas began, and dug along one side, and 
instructed Rollo how to throw up the spadefuls of earth out of the way, 
so that the next spadeful would come up easier.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Jonas, in this way, made a kind of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span>a
 trench all along the side of Rollo's ground; and he told Rollo to be 
careful to throw every spadeful well forward, so as to keep the trench 
open and free, and then it would be easy for him to dig.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Jonas then left him, and told him that there was work enough for him for three or four days, to dig up his ground well.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo went to work, very patiently, for the 
first day, and persevered an hour in digging up his ground. Then he left
 his work for that day; and the next morning, when the regular hour 
which he had allotted to work arrived, he found he had not much 
inclination to return to it. He accordingly asked his father whether it 
would not be a good plan to plant what he had already dug, before he dug
 any more.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What is Jonas's advice?”</span> said his father.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, he told me I had 
better dig it all up first; but I thought that, if I planted part first,
 those things would be growing while I am digging up the rest of the 
ground.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But you must do, you know, as Jonas advises; that is the condition. Next <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span>year, perhaps, you will be old enough to act according to your own judgment; but this year you must follow guidance.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo recollected the condition, and he had nothing to say against it; but he looked dissatisfied.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don't you think that is reasonable, Rollo?”</span> said his father.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why; I don't know,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“This very case shows 
that it is reasonable. Here you want to plant a part before you have got
 the ground prepared. The real reason is because you are tired of 
digging; not because you are really of opinion that that would be a 
better plan. You have not the means of judging whether it is, or is not,
 now, time to begin to put in seeds.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo could not help seeing that that was his 
real motive; and he promised his father that he would go on, though it 
was tiresome. It was not the hard labor of the digging that fatigued 
him, for, by following Jonas's directions, he found it easy work; but it
 was the sameness of it. He longed for something new.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He persevered, however, and it was a valuable lesson to him; for when he had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span>got
 it all done, he was so satisfied with thinking that it was fairly 
completed, and in thinking that now it was all ready together, and that 
he could form a plan for the whole at once, that he determined that 
forever after, when he had any unpleasant piece of work to do, he would 
go on patiently through it, even if it was tiresome.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">With Jonas's help, Rollo planned his garden 
beautifully. He put double rows of peas and beans all around, so that 
when they should grow up, they would enclose his garden like a fence or 
hedge, and make it look snug and pleasant within. Then, he had a row of 
corn, for he thought he should like some green corn himself to roast. 
Then, he had one bed of beets and some hills of muskmelons, and in one 
corner he planted some flower seeds, so that he could have some flowers 
to put into his mother's glasses, for the mantel-piece.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo took great interest in laying out and 
planting his ground, and in watching the garden when the seeds first 
came up; for all this was easy and pleasant work. In the intervals, he 
used to play on his<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span> pleasure-ground, planting and digging, and setting out, just as he pleased.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Sometimes he, and James, and Lucy, would go out 
in the woods with his little wheelbarrow, and dig up roots of flowers 
and little trees there, and bring them in, and set them out here and 
there. But he did not proceed regularly with this ground. He did not dig
 it all up first, and then form a regular plan for the whole; and the 
consequence was, that it soon became very irregular. He would want to 
make a path one day where he had set out a little tree, perhaps, a few 
days before; and it often happened that, when he was making a little 
trench to sow one kind of seeds, out came a whole parcel of others that 
he had put in before, and forgotten.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Then, when the seeds came up in his 
playing-garden, they came up here and there, irregularly; but, in his 
working-garden, all looked orderly and beautiful.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">One evening, just before sundown, Rollo brought 
out his father and mother to look at his two gardens. The difference 
between them was very great; and Rollo, as he ran along before his 
father, said that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span>he thought the working plan of making a garden was a great deal better than the playing plan.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“That depends upon what your object is.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“How so?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, which do you think you have had the most amusement from, thus far?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, I have had most amusement, I suppose, in the little garden in the corner.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said his father, <span class="tei tei-q">“undoubtedly.
 But the other appears altogether the best now, and will produce 
altogether more in the end. So, if your object is useful results, you 
must manage systematically, regularly, and patiently; but if you only 
want amusement as you go along, you had better do every day just as you 
happen to feel inclined.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, father, which do you think is best for a boy?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“For quite small boys, a garden for play is best. They have not patience or industry enough for any other.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you think I have patience or industry enough?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“You have done very well, so far; but the trying time is to come.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, father?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Because the novelty of 
the beginning is over, and now you will have a good deal of hoeing and 
weeding to do for a month to come. I am not sure but that you will 
forfeit your land yet.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But you are to give me three days' notice, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“That is true; but we shall see.”</span></p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">The Trying Time.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The trying time did come, true enough; for, in 
June and July, Rollo found it hard to take proper care of his garden. If
 he had worked resolutely an hour, once or twice a week, it would have 
been enough; but he became interested in other plays, and, when Jonas 
reminded him that the weeds were growing, he would go in and hoe a few 
minutes, and then go away to play.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">At last, one day his father gave him notice that
 his garden was getting out of order, and, unless it was entirely 
restored in three days, it must be forfeited.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span>Rollo was not much alarmed, for he thought he should have ample time to do it before the three days should have expired.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">It was just at night that Rollo received his 
notice. He worked a little the next morning; but his heart was not in it
 much, and he left it before he had made much progress. The weeds were 
well rooted and strong, and he found it much harder to get them up than 
he expected. The next day, he did a little more, and, near the latter 
part of the afternoon, Jonas saw him running about after butterflies in 
the yard, and asked him if he had got his work all done.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said he; <span class="tei tei-q">“but I think I have got more than half done, and I can finish it very early to-morrow.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“To-morrow!”</span> said Jonas. <span class="tei tei-q">“To-morrow is Sunday, and you cannot work then.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is it?”</span> said Rollo, with much surprise and alarm; <span class="tei tei-q">“I didn't know that. What shall I do? Do you suppose my father will count Sunday?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said Jonas, <span class="tei tei-q">“I presume he will. He said, three <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">days</span></span>, without mentioning any thing about Sunday.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span>Rollo
 ran for his hoe. He had become much attached to his ground, and was 
very unwilling to lose it; but he knew that his father would rigorously 
insist on his forfeiting it, if he failed to keep the conditions. So he 
went to work as hard as he could.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">It was then almost sundown. He hoed away, and 
pulled up the weeds, as industriously as possible, until the sun went 
down. He then kept on until it was so dark that he could not see any 
longer, and then, finding that there was considerable more to be done, 
and that he could not work any longer, he sat down on the side of his 
little wheelbarrow, and burst into tears.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He knew, however, that it would do no good to 
cry, and so, after a time, he dried his eyes, and went in. He could not 
help hoping that his father would not count the Sunday; and <span class="tei tei-q">“If I can only have Monday,”</span> said he to himself, <span class="tei tei-q">“it will all be well.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He went in to ask his father, but found that he 
had gone away, and would not come home until quite late. He begged his 
mother to let him sit up until he came <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span>home,
 so that he could ask him, and, as she saw that he was so anxious and 
unhappy about it, she consented. Rollo sat at the window watching, and, 
as soon as he heard his father drive up to the door, he went out, and, 
while he was getting out of the chaise, he said to him, in a trembling, 
faltering voice,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Father, do you count Sunday as one of my three days?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, my son.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo clapped his hands, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“O, how glad!”</span>
 and ran back. He told his mother that he was very much obliged to her 
for letting him sit up, and now he was ready to go to bed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He went to his room, undressed himself, and, in a few minutes, his father came in to get his light.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Father,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am very much obliged to you for not counting Sunday.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is not out of any indulgence to you, Rollo; I have no right to count Sunday.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No right, father? Why, you said three days.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes; but in such agreements as that, three working days are always meant; so that, strictly, according to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span>agreement, I do not think I have any right to count Sunday. If I had, I should have felt obliged to count it.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, father?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Because I want you, when you grow up to be a man, to be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">bound</span></span>
 by your agreements. Men will hold you to your agreements when you are a
 man, and I want you to be accustomed to it while you are a boy. I 
should rather give up twice as much land as your garden, than take yours
 away from you now; but I must do it if you do not get it in good order 
before the time is out.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But, father, I shall, for I shall have time enough on Monday.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“True; but some accident may prevent it. Suppose you should be sick.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“If I was sick, should you count it?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Certainly. You ought 
not to let your garden get out of order; and, if you do it, you run the 
risk of all accidents that may prevent your working during the three 
days.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo bade his father good night, and he went to
 sleep, thinking what a narrow escape he had had. He felt sure that he 
should save it now, for he did not think <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span>there was the least danger of his being sick on Monday.</p>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-div c23">
<a id="toc63"></a> <a id="pdf64"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">A Narrow Escape.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Monday morning came, and, when he awoke, his first movement was, to jump out of bed, exclaiming,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I am not sick this morning, am I?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He had scarcely spoken the words, however, 
before his ear caught the sound of rain, and, looking out of the window,
 he saw, to his utter consternation, that it was pouring steadily down, 
and, from the wind and the gray uniformity of the clouds, there was 
every appearance of a settled storm.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What shall I do?”</span> said Rollo. <span class="tei tei-q">“What shall I do? Why did I not finish it on Saturday?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He dressed himself, went down stairs, and looked
 out at the clouds. There was no prospect of any thing but rain. He ate 
his breakfast, and then went out, and looked again. Rain, still. He 
studied and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span>recited
 his morning lessons, and then again looked out. Rain, rain. He could 
not help hoping it would clear up before night; but, as it continued so 
steadily, he began to be seriously afraid that, after all, he should 
lose his garden.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He spent the day very anxiously and unhappily. 
He knew, from what his father had said, that he could not hope to have 
another day allowed, and that all would depend on his being able to do 
the work before night.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">At last, about the middle of the afternoon, 
Rollo came into the room where his father and mother were sitting, and 
told his father that it did not rain a great deal then, and asked him if
 he might not go out and finish his weeding; he did not care, he said, 
if he did get wet.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But your getting wet will not injure you alone—it will spoil your clothes.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Besides, you will take cold,”</span> said his mother.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Perhaps he would not take cold, if he were to put on dry clothes as soon as he leaves working,”</span> said his father; <span class="tei tei-q">“but wetting his clothes would put you to a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span>good deal of trouble. No; I'd rather you would not go, on the whole, Rollo.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo turned away with tears in his eyes, and 
went out into the kitchen. He sat down on a bench in the shed where 
Jonas was working, and looked out towards the garden. Jonas pitied him, 
and would gladly have gone and done the work for him; but he knew that 
his father would not allow that. At last, a sudden thought struck him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Rollo,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“you might perhaps find some old clothes in the garret, which it would not hurt to get wet.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo jumped up, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us go and see.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">They went up garret, and found, hanging up, 
quite a quantity of old clothes. Some belonged to Jonas, some to 
himself, and they selected the worst ones they could find, and carried 
them down into the shed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Then Rollo went and called his mother to come 
out, and he asked her if she thought it would hurt those old clothes to 
get wet. She laughed, and said no; and said she would go and ask his 
father to let him go out with them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span>In
 a few minutes, she came back, and said that his father consented, but 
that he must go himself, and put on the old clothes, without troubling 
his mother, and then, when he came back, he must rub himself dry with a 
towel, and put on his common dress, and put the wet ones somewhere in 
the shed to dry; and when they were dry, put them all back carefully in 
their places.</p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span>Rollo
 ran up to his room, and rigged himself out, as well as he could, 
putting one of Jonas's great coats over him, and wearing an old 
broad-brimmed straw hat on his head. Thus equipped, he took his hoe, and
 sallied forth in the rain.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">At first he thought it was good fun; but, in 
about half an hour, he began to be tired, and to feel very 
uncomfortable. The rain spattered in his face, and leaked down the back 
of his neck; and then the ground was wet and slippery; and once or twice
 he almost gave up in despair.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He persevered, however, and before dark he got 
it done. He raked off all the weeds, and smoothed the ground over 
carefully, for he knew his father would come out to examine it as soon 
as the storm was over. Then he went in, rubbed himself dry, changed his 
clothes, and went and took his seat by the kitchen fire.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">His father came out a few minutes after, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, Rollo, have you got through?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I am <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">very</span></span> glad of it. I was afraid you would have lost your garden. As it is, perhaps it will do you good.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“How?”</span> said Rollo. <span class="tei tei-q">“What good?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“It will teach you, I 
hope, that it is dangerous to neglect or postpone doing one's duty. We 
cannot always depend on repairing the mischief. When the proper 
opportunity is once lost, it may never return.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo said nothing, but he thought he should remember the lesson as long as he lived.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He remembered it for the rest of that summer, at
 any rate, and did not run any more risks. He kept his ground very neat,
 and his father did not have to give him notice again. His corn grew 
finely, and he had many a good roasting ear from it; and his flowers 
helped ornament the parlor mantel-piece all the summer; and the green 
peas, and the beans, and the muskmelons, and the other vegetables, which
 his father took and paid for, amounted to more than two dollars.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span></p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Advice.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, Rollo,”</span> 
said his father, one evening, as he was sitting on his cricket before a 
bright, glowing fire, late in the autumn, after all his fruits were 
gathered in, <span class="tei tei-q">“you have really done some work this summer, haven't you?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir,”</span> said Rollo; and he began to reckon up the amount of peas, and beans, and corn, and other things, that he had raised.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said his father, <span class="tei tei-q">“you
 have had a pretty good garden; but the best of it is your own 
improvement. You are really beginning to get over some of the faults of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">boy work</span></span>.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What are the faults of boy work?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“One of the first is, 
confounding work with play,—or rather expecting the pleasure of play, 
while they are doing work. There is great pleasure in doing work, as I 
have told you before, when it is well and properly done, but it is very 
different from the pleasure of play. It comes later; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span>generally after the work is done. While you are doing your work, it requires <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">exertion</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">self-denial</span></span>, and sometimes the sameness is tiresome.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is so with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">men</span></span> when they work, but they expect it will be so, and persevere notwithstanding; but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">boys</span></span>,
 who have not learned this, expect their work will be play; and, when 
they find it is not so, they get tired, and want to leave it or to find 
some new way.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“You showed your wish to
 make play of your work, that day when you were getting in your chips, 
by insisting on having just such a basket as you happened to fancy; and 
then, when you got a little tired of that, going for the wheelbarrow; 
and then leaving the chips altogether, and going to piling the wood.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, father,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“do not men try to make their work as pleasant as they can?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, but they do not continually change from one thing to another in hopes to make it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">amusing</span></span>. They always expect that it will be laborious and tiresome, and they understand this before<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span>hand, and go steadily forward notwithstanding. You are beginning to learn to do this.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Another fault, which 
you boys are very apt to fall into, is impatience. This comes from the 
first fault; for you expect, when you go to work, the kind of pleasure 
you have in play, and when you find you do not obtain it, or meet with 
any difficulties, you grow impatient, and get tired of what you are 
doing.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“From this follows the third fault—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">changeableness</span></span>,
 or want of perseverance. Instead of steadily going forward in the way 
they commence, boys are very apt to abandon one thing after another, and
 to try this new way, and that new way, so as to accomplish very little 
in any thing.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you think I have overcome all these?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“In part,”</span> said his father; <span class="tei tei-q">“you begin to understand something about them, and to be on your guard against them. But you have only made a beginning.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Only a beginning?”</span> said Rollo; <span class="tei tei-q">“why, I thought I had learned to work pretty well.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“So
 you have, for a little boy; but it is only a beginning, after all. I 
don't think you would succeed in persevering steadily, so as to 
accomplish any serious undertaking now.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, father, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">I</span></span> think I should.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Suppose I should give 
you the Latin grammar to learn in three months, and tell you that, at 
the end of that time, I would hear you recite it all at once. Do you 
suppose you should be ready?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, father, that is not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">work</span></span>.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said his father, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
 is one kind of work,—and just such a kind of work, so far as patience, 
steadiness, and perseverance, are needed, as you will have most to do, 
in future years. But if I were to give it to you to do, and then say 
nothing to you about it till you had time to have learned the whole, I 
have some doubts whether you would recite a tenth part of it.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo was silent; he knew it would be just so.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, my little son,”</span> said his father, putting him down and patting his head, <span class="tei tei-q">“you have got a great deal to learn <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span>before
 you become a man; but then you have got some years to learn it in; that
 is a comfort. But now it is time for you to go to bed; so good night.”</span></p>

<a id="toc70"></a> <a id="pdf71"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">The Garden-House.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">There was a certain building on one side of Farmer Cropwell's yard which they called the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">garden-house</span></span>.
 There was one large double door which opened from it into the garden, 
and another smaller one which led to the yard towards the house. On one 
side of this room were a great many different kinds of garden-tools, 
such as hoes, rakes, shovels, and spades; there were one or two 
wheelbarrows, and little wagons. Over these were two or three broad 
shelves, with baskets, and bundles of matting, and ropes, and chains, 
and various iron tools. Around the wall, in different places, various 
things were hung up—here a row of augers, there a trap, and in other 
places parts of harness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span>Opposite
 to these, there was a large bench, which extended along the whole side.
 At one end of this bench there were a great many carpenter's tools; and
 the other was covered with papers of seeds, and little bundles of dried
 plants, which Farmer Cropwell had just been getting in from the garden.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The farmer and one of his boys was at work here,
 arranging his seeds, and doing up his bundles, one pleasant morning in 
the fall, when a boy about twelve years old came running to the door of 
the garden-house, from the yard, playing with a large dog. The dog ran 
behind him, jumping up upon him; and when they got to the door, the boy 
ran in quick, laughing, and shut the door suddenly, so that the dog 
could not come in after him. This boy's name was George: the dog's name 
was Nappy—that is, they always called him Nappy. His true name was 
Napoleon; though James always thought that he got his name from the long
 naps he used to take in a certain sunny corner of the yard.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">But, as I said before, George got into the garden-house, and shut Nappy out. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span>He stood there holding the door, and said,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Father, all the horses have been watered but Jolly: may I ride him to the brook?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said his father.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So George turned round, and opened the door a little way, and peeped out.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, old Nappy! you are there still, are you, wagging your tail? Don't you wish you could catch him?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">George then shut the door, and walked softly 
across to the great door leading out into the garden. From here he stole
 softly around into the barn, by a back way, and then came forward, and 
peeped out in front, and saw that Nappy was still there, sitting up, and
 looking at the door very closely. He was waiting for George to come 
out.</p>

<div class="tei tei-div c23">
<a id="toc72"></a> <a id="pdf73"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Jolly.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">George then went back to the stall where Jolly was feeding. He went in and untied his halter, and led him out. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span>Jolly
 was a sleek, black, beautiful little horse, not old enough to do much 
work, but a very good horse to ride. George took down a bridle, and, 
after leading Jolly to a horse-block, where he could stand up high 
enough to reach his head, he put the bridle on, and then jumped up upon 
his back, and walked him out of the barn by a door where Nappy could not
 see them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He then rode round by the other side of the 
house, until he came to the road, and he went along the road until he 
could see up the yard to the place where Nappy was watching. He called 
out, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Nappy!</span></span> in a
 loud voice, and then immediately set his horse off upon a run. Nappy 
looked down to the road, and was astonished to see George upon the 
horse, when he supposed he was still behind the door where he was 
watching, and he sprang forward, and set off after him in full pursuit.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He caught George just as he was riding down into
 the brook. George was looking round and laughing at him as he came up; 
but Nappy looked quite grave, and did nothing but go down into the 
brook, and lap up water with his tongue, while the horse drank.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span>While the horse was drinking, Rollo came along the road, and George asked him how his garden came on.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, very well,”</span> said Rollo. <span class="tei tei-q">“Father is going to give me a larger one next year.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Have you got a strawberry-bed?”</span> said George.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I should think you would have a strawberry-bed. My father will give you some plants, and you can set them out this fall.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don't know how to set them out,”</span> said Rollo. <span class="tei tei-q">“Could you come and show me?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">George said he would ask his father; and then, as his horse had done drinking, he turned round, and rode home again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Mr. Cropwell said that he would give Rollo a 
plenty of strawberry-plants, and, as to George's helping him set them 
out, he said that they might exchange works. If Rollo would come and 
help George gather his meadow-russets, George might go and help him make
 his strawberry-bed. That evening, George went and told Rollo of this 
plan, and Rollo's father approved of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span>it. So it was agreed that, the next day, he should go to help them gather the russets. They invited James to go too.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">The Pet Lamb.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The next morning, James and Rollo went together 
to the farmer's. They found George at the gate waiting for them, with 
his dog Nappy. As the boys were walking along into the yard, George said
 that his dog Nappy was the best friend he had in the world, except his 
lamb.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Your lamb!”</span> said James; <span class="tei tei-q">“have you got a lamb?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, a most beautiful 
little lamb. When he was very little indeed, he was weak and sick, and 
father thought he would not live; and he told me I might have him if I 
wanted him. I made a bed for him in the corner of the kitchen.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, I wish I had one,”</span> said James. <span class="tei tei-q">“Where is he now?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, he is grown up large, and he plays around in the field behind the house. If I go out there with a little pan of milk, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span>and call him so,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Co-nan</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Co-nan</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Co-nan</span></span>,—he comes running up to me to get the milk.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wish I could see him,”</span> said James.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, you can,”</span> said George. <span class="tei tei-q">“My sister Ann will go and show him to you.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So George called his sister Ann, and asked her 
if she should be willing to go and show James and Rollo his lamb, while 
he went and got the little wagon ready to go for the apples.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Ann said she would, and she went into the house,
 and got a pan with a little milk in the bottom of it, and walked along 
carefully, James and Rollo following her. When they had got round to the
 other side of the house, they found there a little gate, leading out 
into a field where there were green grass and little clumps of trees.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Ann went carefully through. James and Rollo 
stopped to look. She walked on a little way, and looked around every 
where, but she saw no lamb. Presently she began to call out, as George 
had said, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Co-nan</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Co-nan</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">Co-nan</span></span>.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">In a minute or two, the lamb began to run towards her out of a little thicket of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span>bushes;
 and it drank the milk out of the pan. James and Rollo were very much 
pleased, but they did not go towards the lamb. Ann let it drink all it 
wanted, and then it walked away.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Then James ran back to the yard. He found that 
George and Rollo had gone into the garden-house. He went in there after 
them, and found that they were getting a little wagon ready to draw out 
into the field. There were three barrels standing by the door of the 
garden-house, and George told them that they were to put their apples 
into them.</p>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-div c23">
<a id="toc76"></a> <a id="pdf77"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">The Meadow-Russet.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">There was a beautiful meadow down a little way 
from Farmer Cropwell's house, and at the farther side of it, across a 
brook, there stood a very large old apple-tree, which bore a kind of 
apples called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">russets</span></span>, and they called the tree the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">meadow-russet</span></span>. These were the apples that the boys were <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span>going
 to gather. They soon got ready, and began to walk along the path 
towards the meadow. Two of them drew the wagon, and the others carried 
long poles to knock off the apples with.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">As the party were descending the hill towards 
the meadow, they saw before them, coming around a turn in the path, a 
cart and oxen, with a large boy driving. They immediately began to call 
out to one another to turn out, some pulling one way and some the other,
 with much noise and vociferation. At last they got fairly out upon the 
grass, and the cart went by. The boy who was driving it said, as he went
 by, smiling,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who is the head of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">that</span></span> gang?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">James and Rollo looked at him, wondering what he meant. George laughed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What does he mean?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“He means,”</span> said George, laughing, <span class="tei tei-q">“that we make so much noise and confusion, that we cannot have any head.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Any head?”</span> said James.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,—any master workman.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“do we need a master workman?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said George, <span class="tei tei-q">“I don't believe we do.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So the boys went along until they came to the 
brook. They crossed the brook on a bridge of planks, and were very soon 
under the spreading branches of the great apple-tree.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Insubordination.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The boys immediately began the work of getting 
down the apples. But, unluckily, there were but two poles, and they all 
wanted them. George had one, and James the other, and Rollo came up to 
James, and took hold of his pole, saying,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Here, James, I will knock them down; you may pick them up and put them in the wagon.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said James, holding fast to his pole; <span class="tei tei-q">“no, I'd rather knock them down.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“I can knock them down better.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But I got the pole first, and I ought to have it.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo, finding that James was not willing to 
give up his pole, left him, and went to George, and asked George to let 
him have the pole; but George said he was taller, and could use it 
better than Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo was a little out of humor at this, and 
stood aside and looked on. James soon got tired of his pole, and laid it
 down; and then Rollo seized it, and began knocking the apples off of 
the tree. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span>But it 
fatigued him very much to reach up so high; and, in fact, they all three
 got tired of the poles very soon, and began picking up the apples.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">But they did not go on any more harmoniously 
with this than with the other. After Rollo and James had thrown in 
several apples, George came and turned them all out.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“You must not put them in so,”</span> said he; <span class="tei tei-q">“all the good and bad ones together.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“How must we put them in?”</span> asked Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, first we must get a load of good, large, whole, round apples, and then a load of small and wormy ones. We only put the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">good</span></span> ones into the barrels.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“And what do you do with the little ones?”</span> said James.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, we give them to the pigs.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“we can pick them all up together now, and separate them when we get home.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">As he said this, he threw in a handful of small apples among the good ones which George had been putting in.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Be still,”</span> said George; <span class="tei tei-q">“you must <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span>not do so. I tell you we must not mix them at all.”</span> And he poured the apples out upon the ground again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, I'll tell you what we will do,”</span> said James; <span class="tei tei-q">“we will get a load of little ones first, and then the big ones. I want to see the pigs eat them up.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">But George thought it was best to take the big 
ones first, and so they had quite a discussion about it, and a great 
deal of time was lost before they could agree.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Thus they went on for some time, discussing 
every thing, and each wanting to do the work in his own way. They did 
not dispute much, it is true, for neither of them wished to make 
difficulty. But each thought he might direct as well as the others, and 
so they had much talk and clamor, and but very little work. When one 
wanted the wagon to be on one side of the tree, the others wanted it the
 other; and when George thought it was time to draw the load along 
towards home, Rollo and James thought it was not nearly full enough. So 
they were all pulling in different directions, and made very slow 
progress in their work. It took them a long time to get their wagon 
full.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span>When
 they got the load ready, and were fairly set off on the road, they went
 on smoothly and pleasantly for a time, until they got up near the door 
of the garden-house, when Rollo was going to turn the wagon round so as 
to back it up to the door, and George began to pull in the other 
direction.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not so, Rollo,”</span> said George; <span class="tei tei-q">“go right up straight.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is better to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">back</span></span> it up.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">James had something to say, too; and they all 
pulled, and talked loud and all together, so that there was nothing but 
noise and clamor. In the mean time, the wagon, being pulled every way, 
of course did not move at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-div c23">
<a id="toc81"></a> <a id="pdf82"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Subordination.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Presently Farmer Cropwell made his appearance at the door of the garden-house.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, boys,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“you seem to be pretty good-natured, and I am glad of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span>that; but you are certainly the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">noisiest</span></span> workmen, of your size, that I ever heard.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, father,”</span> said George, <span class="tei tei-q">“I want to go right up to the door, straight, and Rollo won't let me.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Must not we back it up?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is that the way you have been working all the morning?”</span> said the farmer.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“How?”</span> said George.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, all generals and no soldiers.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Sir?”</span> said George.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“All of you commanding, 
and none obeying. There is nothing but confusion and noise. I don't see 
how you can gather apples so. How many have you got in?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So saying, he went and looked into the barrels.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“None,”</span> said he; <span class="tei tei-q">“I thought so.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He stood still a minute, as if thinking what to 
do; and then he told them to leave the wagon there, and go with him, and
 he would show them the way to work.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The boys accordingly walked along after him, through the garden-house, into <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span>the
 yard. They then went across the road, and down behind a barn, to a 
place where some men were building a stone bridge. They stopped upon a 
bank at some distance, and looked down upon them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“There,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“see how men work!”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">It happened, at that time, that all the men were
 engaged in moving a great stone with iron bars. There was scarcely any 
thing said by any of them. Every thing went on silently, but the stone 
moved regularly into its place.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, boys, do you understand,”</span> said the farmer, <span class="tei tei-q">“how they get along so quietly?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, it is because they are men, and not boys,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said the farmer, <span class="tei tei-q">“that is not the reason. It is because they have a head.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“A head?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“a head; that is, one man to direct, and the rest obey.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Which is it?”</span> said George.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is that man who is pointing now,”</span> said the farmer, <span class="tei tei-q">“to another stone. He <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span>is
 telling them which to take next. Watch them now, and you will see that 
he directs every thing, and the rest do just as he says. But you are all
 directing and commanding together, and there is nobody to obey. If you 
were moving those stones, you would be all advising and disputing 
together, and pulling in every direction at once, and the stone would 
not move at all.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><a id="figlist83"></a></p>

<div class="tei tei-head c13">There, Said He, See How Men Work.</div>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“And do men always appoint a head,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“when they work together?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said the farmer, <span class="tei tei-q">“they do not always <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">appoint</span></span> one regularly, but they always <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">have</span></span>
 one, in some way or other. Even when no one is particularly authorized 
to direct, they generally let the one who is oldest, or who knows most 
about the business, take the lead, and the rest do as he says.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">They all then walked slowly back to the 
garden-house, and the farmer advised them to have a head, if they wanted
 their business to go on smoothly and well.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who do you think ought to be our head?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“The one who is the oldest, and knows <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span>most about the business,”</span> said the farmer, <span class="tei tei-q">“and
 that, I suppose, would be George. But perhaps you had better take 
turns, and let each one be head for one load, and then you will all 
learn both to command and to obey.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So the boys agreed that George should command 
while they got the next load, and James and Rollo agreed to obey. The 
farmer told them they must obey exactly, and good-naturedly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“You must not even <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">advise</span></span>
 him what to do, or say any thing about it at all, except in some 
extraordinary case; but, when you talk, talk about other things 
altogether, and work on exactly as he shall say.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What if we <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">know</span></span> there is a better way? must not we tell him?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said the farmer, <span class="tei tei-q">“unless
 it is something very uncommon. It is better to go wrong sometimes, 
under a head, than to be endlessly talking and disputing how you shall 
go. Therefore you must do exactly what he says, even if you know a 
better way, and see if you do not get along much faster.”</span></p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">The New Plan Tried.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The boys determined to try the plan, and, after 
putting their first load of apples into the barrel, they set off again 
under George's command. He told Rollo and James to draw the wagon, while
 he ran along behind. When they got to the tree, Rollo took up a pole, 
and began to beat down some more apples; but George told him that they 
must first pick up what were knocked down before; and he drew the wagon 
round to the place where he thought it was best for it to stand. The 
other boys made no objection, but worked industriously, picking up all 
the small and worm-eaten apples they could find; and, in a very short 
time, they had the wagon loaded, and were on their way to the house 
again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Still, Rollo and James had to make so great an 
effort to avoid interfering with George's directions, that they did not 
really enjoy this trip quite so well as they did the first. It was 
pleasant to them to be more at liberty, and they thought, on the whole, 
that they did not like having a head quite so well as being without one.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span>Instead
 of going up to the garden-house, George ordered them to take this load 
to the barn, to put it in a bin where all such apples were to go. When 
they came back, the farmer came again to the door of the garden-house.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, boys,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“you have come rather quicker this time. How do you like that way of working?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, not quite so well,”</span> said Rollo. <span class="tei tei-q">“I do not think it is so pleasant as the other way.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is not such good <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">play</span></span>, perhaps; but don't you think it makes better <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">work</span></span>?”</span> said he.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The boys admitted that they got their apples in 
faster, and, as they were at work then, and not at play, they resolved 
to continue the plan.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Farmer Cropwell then asked who was to take command the next time.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Rollo,”</span> said the boys.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, Rollo,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
 want you to have a large number of apples knocked down this time, and 
then select from them the largest and nicest you can. I want one load 
for a particular purpose.”</span></p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">A Present.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The boys worked on industriously, and, before 
dinner-time, they had gathered all the apples. The load of best apples, 
which the farmer had requested them to bring for a particular purpose, 
were put into a small square box, until it was full, and then a cover 
was nailed on; the rest were laid upon the great bench. When, at length,
 the work was all done, and they were ready to go home, the farmer put 
this box into the wagon, so that it stood up in the middle, leaving a 
considerable space before and behind it. He put the loose apples into 
this space, some before and some behind, until the wagon was full.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, James and Rollo, I want you to draw these apples for me, when you go home,”</span> said the farmer.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who are they for?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I will mark them,”</span> said he.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So he took down a little curious-looking tin 
dipper, with a top sloping in all around, and with a hole in the middle 
of it. A long, slender brush-handle was standing up in this hole.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span>When he took out the brush, the boys saw that it was blacking. With this blacking-brush he wrote on the top of the box,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c18">Lucy</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is that box for my cousin Lucy?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said he; <span class="tei tei-q">“you can draw it to her, can you not?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“we will. And who are the other apples for? You cannot mark <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">them</span></span>.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said the farmer; <span class="tei tei-q">“but
 you will remember. Those before the box are for you, and those behind 
it for James. So drive along. George will come to your house, this 
afternoon, with the strawberry plants, and then he can bring the wagon 
home.”</span></p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">The Strawberry-Bed.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">George Cropwell came, soon after, to Rollo's 
house, and helped him make a fine strawberry-bed, which, he said, he 
thought would bear considerably the next year. They dug up the ground, 
raked it over carefully, and then put in the plants in rows.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span>After
 it was all done, Rollo got permission of his father to go back with 
George to take the wagon home; and George proposed to take Rollo's 
wheelbarrow too. He had never seen such a pretty little wheelbarrow, and
 was very much pleased with it. So George ran on before, trundling the 
wheelbarrow, and Rollo came after, drawing the wagon.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Just as they came near the farmer's house, 
George saw, on before him, a ragged little boy, much smaller than Rollo,
 who was walking along barefooted.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“There's Tom,”</span> said George.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Tom. See how I will frighten him.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">As he said this, George darted forward with his 
wheelbarrow, and trundled it on directly towards Tom, as if he was going
 to run over him. Tom looked round, and then ran away, the wheelbarrow 
at his heels. He was frightened very much, and began to scream; and, 
just then, Farmer Cropwell, who at that moment happened to be coming up a
 lane, on the opposite side of the road, called out,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“George!”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">George stopped his wheelbarrow.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“Is that right?”</span> said the farmer.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, I was not going to hurt him,”</span> said George.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“You <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">did</span></span> hurt him—you frightened him.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is frightening him hurting him, father?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, yes, it is giving him <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">pain</span></span>, and a very unpleasant kind of pain too.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I did not think of that,”</span> said George.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Besides,”</span> said his father, <span class="tei tei-q">“when you treat boys in that harsh, rough way, you make them your enemies; and it is a very bad plan to make enemies.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Enemies, father!”</span> said George, laughing; <span class="tei tei-q">“Tom could not do me any harm, if he was my enemy.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“That makes me think of the story of the bear and the tomtit,”</span> said the farmer; <span class="tei tei-q">“and, if you and Rollo will jump up in the cart, I will tell it to you.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Thus far, while they had been talking, the boys 
had walked along by the side of the road, keeping up with the farmer as 
he drove along in the cart. But now they jumped in, and sat down with 
the farmer on his seat, which was a board laid across from one side of 
the cart to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span>other. As soon as they were seated, the farmer began.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">The Farmer's Story.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“The story I was going to tell you, boys, is an old fable about making enemies. It is called <span class="tei tei-q">‘The Bear and the Tomtit.’</span> ”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What is a tomtit?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is a kind of a bird,
 a very little bird; but he sings pleasantly. Well, one pleasant 
summer's day, a wolf and a bear were taking a walk together in a lonely 
wood. They heard something singing.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Brother,’</span> said the bear, <span class="tei tei-q">‘that is good singing: what sort of a bird do you think that may be?’</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘That's a tomtit,’</span> said the wolf.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘I should like to see his nest,’</span> said the bear; <span class="tei tei-q">‘where do you think it is?’</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘If we wait a little time, till his mate comes home, we shall see,’</span> said the wolf.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“The bear and the wolf walked backward and forward some time, till his mate came home with some food in her mouth <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span>for
 her children. The wolf and the bear watched her. She went to the tree 
where the bird was singing, and they together flew to a little grove 
just by, and went to their nest.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Now,’</span> said the bear, <span class="tei tei-q">‘let us go and see.’</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘No,’</span> said the wolf, <span class="tei tei-q">‘we must wait till the old birds have gone away again.’</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“So they noticed the place, and walked away.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“They did not stay long,
 for the bear was very impatient to see the nest. They returned, and the
 bear scrambled up the tree, expecting to amuse himself finely by 
frightening the young tomtits.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Take care,’</span> said the wolf; <span class="tei tei-q">‘you had better be careful. The tomtits are little; but little enemies are sometimes very troublesome.’</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Who is afraid of a tomtit?’</span> said the bear.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“So saying, he poked his great black nose into the nest.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Who is here?’</span> said he; <span class="tei tei-q">‘what are you?’</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“The poor birds screamed out with terror. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Go away! Go away!’</span> said they.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘What do you mean by making such a noise,’</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">‘and talking so to me? I will teach you better.’</span>
 So he put his great paw on the nest, and crowded it down until the poor
 little birds were almost stifled. Presently he left them, and went 
away.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“The young tomtits were 
terribly frightened, and some of them were hurt. As soon as the bear was
 gone, their fright gave way to anger; and, soon after, the old birds 
came home, and were very indignant too. They used to see the bear, 
occasionally, prowling about the woods, but did not know what they could
 do to bring him to punishment.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, there was a famous
 glen, surrounded by high rocks, where the bear used to go and sleep, 
because it was a wild, solitary place. The tomtits often saw him there. 
One day, the bear was prowling around, and he saw, at a great distance, 
two huntsmen, with guns, coming towards the wood. He fled to his glen in
 dismay, though he thought he should be safe there.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“The tomtits were flying about there, and presently they saw the huntsmen. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><span class="tei tei-q">‘Now,’</span> said one of them to the other, <span class="tei tei-q">‘is the time to get rid of the tyrant; you go and see if he is in his glen, and then come back to where you hear me singing.’</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“So he flew about from 
tree to tree, keeping in sight of the huntsmen, and singing all the 
time; while the other went and found that the bear was in his glen, 
crouched down in terror behind a rock.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“The tomtits then began 
to flutter around the huntsmen, and fly a little way towards the glen, 
and then back again. This attracted the notice of the men, and they 
followed them to see what could be the matter.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“By and by, the bear saw
 the terrible huntsmen coming, led on by his little enemies, the 
tomtits. He sprang forward, and ran from one side of the glen to the 
other; but he could not escape. They shot him with two bullets through 
his head.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“The wolf happened to be
 near by, at that time, upon the rocks that were around the glen; and, 
hearing all this noise, he came and peeped over. As soon as he saw how 
the case stood, he thought it would be most prudent for him to walk 
away; which he did, saying, as he went.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Well, the bear has found out that it is better to have a person a friend than an enemy, whether he is great or small.’</span> ”</span></p>
<div class="tei tei-tb">
<hr class="c15">
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Here the farmer paused—he had ended the story.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“And what did they do with the bear?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, they took off his skin to make caps of, and nailed his claws up on the barn.”</span></p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span> <a id="toc92"></a> <a id="pdf93"></a>
<h1 class="tei tei-head c17"><span class="c16">Georgie.</span></h1>
<div class="tei tei-div c23">
<a id="toc94"></a> <a id="pdf95"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">The Little Landing.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">A short distance from where Rollo lives, there 
is a small, but very pleasant house, just under the hill, where you go 
down to the stone bridge leading over the brook. There is a noble large 
apple tree on one side of the house, which bears a beautiful, sweet, and
 mellow kind of apple, called golden pippins. A great many other trees 
and flowers are around the house, and in the little garden on the side 
of it towards the brook. There is a small white gate that leads to the 
house, from the road; and there is a pleasant path leading right out 
from the front door, through the garden, down to the water. This is the 
house that Georgie lives in.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">One evening, just before sunset, Rollo was coming along over the stone bridge, towards home. He stopped a moment to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span>look over the railing, down into the water. Presently he heard a very sweet-toned voice calling out to him,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Rol-lo.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo looked along in the direction in which the
 sound came. It was from the bank of the stream, a little way from the 
road, at the place where the path from Georgie's house came down to the 
water. The brook was broad, and the water pretty smooth and still here; 
and it was a place where Rollo had often been to sail boats with 
Georgie. There was a little smooth, sandy place on the shore, at the 
foot of the path, and they used to call it Georgie's landing; and there 
was a seat close by, under the bushes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo thought it was Georgie's voice that called
 him, and in a minute, he saw him sitting on his little seat, with his 
crutches by his side. Georgie was a sick boy. He could not walk, but had
 to sit almost all day, at home, in a large easy chair, which his father
 had bought for him. In the winter, his chair was established in a 
particular corner, by the side of the fire, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span>and
 he had a little case of shelves and drawers, painted green, by the side
 of him. In these shelves and drawers he had his books and 
playthings,—his pen and ink,—his paint-box, brushes and pencils,—his 
knife, and a little saw,—and a great many things which he used to make 
for his amusement. Then, in the summer, his chair, and his shelves and 
drawers, were moved to the end window, which looked out upon the garden 
and brook. Sometimes, when he was better than usual, he could move about
 a little upon crutches; and, at such times, when it was pleasant, he 
used to go out into the garden, and down, through it, to his landing, at
 the brook.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Georgie had been sick a great many years, and 
when Rollo and Jonas first knew him, he used to be very sad and unhappy.
 It was because the poor little fellow had nothing to do. His father had
 to work pretty hard to get food and clothing for his family; he loved 
little Georgie very much, but he could not buy him many things. 
Sometimes people who visited him, used to give him playthings, and they 
would amuse him a little while,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span> but he soon grew tired of them, and had them put away. It is very hard for any body to be happy who has not any thing to do.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">It was Jonas that taught Georgie what to do. He 
lent him his knife, and brought him some smooth, soft, pine wood, and 
taught him to make wind-mills and little boxes. Georgie liked this very 
much, and used to sit by his window in the summer mornings, and make 
playthings, hours at a time. After he had made several things, Jonas 
told the boys that lived about there, that they had better buy them of 
him, when they had a few cents to spend for toys; and they did. In fact,
 they liked the little windmills, and wagons, and small framed houses 
that Georgie made, better than sugar-plums and candy. Besides, they 
liked to go and see Georgie; for, whenever they went to buy any thing of
 him, he looked so contented and happy, sitting in his easy chair, with 
his small and slender feet drawn up under him, and his work on the table
 by his side.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Then he was a very beautiful boy too. His face 
was delicate and pale, but there was such a kind and gentle expression 
in his mild blue eye, and so much sweetness <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span>in the tone of his voice, that they loved very much to go and see him. In fact, all the boys were very fond of Georgie.</p>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-div c23">
<a id="toc96"></a> <a id="pdf97"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Georgie's Money.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Georgie, at length, earned, in this way, quite a
 little sum of money. It was nearly all in cents; but then there was one
 fourpence which a lady gave him for a four-wheeled wagon that he made. 
He kept this money in a corner of his drawer, and, at last, there was 
quite a handful of it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">One summer evening, when Georgie's father came 
home from his work, he hung up his hat, and came and sat down in 
Georgie's corner, by the side of his little boy. Georgie looked up to 
him with a smile.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, father,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“are you tired to-night?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“You are the one to be tired, Georgie,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“sitting here alone all day.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hold up your hand, father,”</span> said Georgie, reaching out his own at the same time, which was shut up, and appeared to have something in it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, what have you got for me?”</span> said his father.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hold fast all I give you,”</span> replied he; and he dropped the money all into his father's hand, and shut up his father's fingers over it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What is all this?”</span> said his father.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is my money,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“for you. It is 'most all cents, but then there is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">one</span></span> fourpence.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am sure, I am much obliged to you, Georgie, for this.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O no,”</span> said Georgie, <span class="tei tei-q">“it's only a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">little</span></span> of what you have to spend for me.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Georgie's father took the money, and put it in 
his pocket, and the next day he went to Jonas, and told him about it, 
and asked Jonas to spend it in buying such things as he thought would be
 useful to Georgie; either playthings, or tools, or materials to work 
with.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Jonas said he should be very glad to do it, for 
he thought he could buy him some things that would help him very much in
 his work. Jonas carried the money into the city the next time he went, 
and bought him a small hone to sharpen his knife, a fine-toothed saw, 
and a bottle of black var<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span>nish,
 with a little brush, to put it on with. He brought these things home, 
and gave them to Georgie's father; and he carried them into the house, 
and put them in a drawer.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">That evening, when Georgie was at supper, his 
father slyly put the things that Jonas had bought on his table, so that 
when he went back, after supper, he found them there. He was very much 
surprised and pleased. He examined them all very particularly, and was 
especially glad to have the black varnish, for now he could varnish his 
work, and make it look much more handsome. The little boxes that he 
made, after this, of a bright black outside, and lined neatly with paper
 within, were thought by the boys to be elegant.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He could now earn money faster, and, as his 
father insisted on having all his earnings expended for articles for 
Georgie's own use, and Jonas used to help him about expending it, he 
got, at last, quite a variety of implements and articles. He had some 
wire, and a little pair of pliers for bending it in all shapes, and a 
hammer and little nails. He had also a paint-box and brushes, and paper 
of various colors, for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span>lining
 boxes, and making portfolios and pocket-books; and he had varnishes, 
red, green, blue, and black. All these he kept in his drawers and 
shelves, and made a great many ingenious things with them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So Georgie was a great friend of both Rollo and 
Jonas, and they often used to come and see him, and play with him; and 
that was the reason that Rollo knew his voice so well, when he called to
 him from the landing, when Rollo was standing on the bridge, as 
described in the beginning of this story.</p>

<a id="toc98"></a> <a id="pdf99"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">Two Good Friends.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo ran along to the end of the bridge, 
clambered down to the water's edge, went along the shore among the trees
 and shrubbery, until he came to the seat where Georgie was sitting. 
Georgie asked him to sit down, and stay with him; but Rollo said he must
 go directly home; and so Georgie took his crutches, and they began to 
walk slowly together up the garden walk.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Where have you been, Rollo?”</span> said Georgie.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“I have been to see my cousin James, to ask him to go to the city with us to-morrow.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Are you going to the city?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes; uncle George gave 
James and I a half a dollar apiece, the other day; and mother is going 
to carry us into the city to-morrow to buy something with it.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is Jonas going with you?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said Rollo. <span class="tei tei-q">“He is going to drive. We are going in our carryall.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wish you would take some money for me, then, and get Jonas to buy me something with it.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I will,”</span> said Rollo. <span class="tei tei-q">“What shall he buy for you?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, he may buy any thing he chooses.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, but if you do not tell him what to buy, he may buy something you have got already.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, Jonas knows every thing I have got as well as I do.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Just then they came up near the house, and Georgie asked Rollo to look up at the golden pippin tree, and see how full it was.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“That is my branch,”</span> said he.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He pointed to a large branch which came out on one side, and which hung<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span> down loaded with fruit. It would have broken down, perhaps, if there had not been a crotched pole put under it, to prop it up.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But all the apples on your branch are not golden pippins,”</span> said Rollo. <span class="tei tei-q">“There are some on it that are red. What beautiful red apples!”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said Georgie. <span class="tei tei-q">“Father grafted that for me, to make it bear rosy-boys. I call the red ones my rosy-boys.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Grafted?”</span> said Rollo; <span class="tei tei-q">“how did he graft it?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O,”</span> said Georgie, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
 do not know exactly. He cut off a little branch from a rosy-boy tree, 
and stuck it on somehow, and it grew, and bears rosy-boys still.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo thought this was very curious; Georgie 
told him he would give him an apple, and that he might have his choice—a
 pippin or a rosy-boy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo hesitated, and looked at them, first at 
one, and then at another; but he could not decide. The rosy-boys had the
 brightest and most beautiful color, but then the pippins looked so rich
 and mellow, that he could not choose very easily; and so Georgie 
laughed, find told him he<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span> would settle the difficulty by giving him one of each.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“So come here,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“Rollo, and let me lean on you, while I knock them down.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So Rollo came and stood near him, while Georgie 
leaned on him, and with his crutch gave a gentle tap to one of each of 
his kinds of apples, and they fell down upon the soft grass, safe and 
sound.</p>

 then went into the house, and Georgie gave Rollo his money, wrapped up 
in a small piece of paper; and then Rollo, bidding him good by, went out
 of the little white gate, and walked along home.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The next morning, soon after breakfast, Jonas 
drove the carryall up to the front door, and Rollo and his mother walked
 out to it. Rollo's mother took the back seat, and Rollo and Jonas sat 
in front, and they drove along.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">They called at the house where James lived, and found him waiting for them on the front steps, with his half dollar in his hand.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">He ran into the house to tell his mother that 
the carryall had come, and to bid her good morning, and then he came out
 to the gate.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“James,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“you may sit on the front seat with Jonas, if you want to.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">James said he should like to very much; and so 
Rollo stepped over behind, and sat with his mother. This was kind and 
polite; for boys all like the front seat when they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span>are riding, and Rollo therefore did right to offer it to his cousin.</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">A Lecture On Playthings.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">After a short time, they came to a smooth and 
pleasant road, with trees and farm-houses on each side; and as the horse
 was trotting along quietly, Rollo asked his mother if she could not 
tell them a story.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I cannot tell you a story very well, this morning, but I can give you a lecture on playthings, if you wish.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Very well, mother, we should like that,”</span> said the boys.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">They did not know very well what a lecture was, 
but they thought that any thing which their mother would propose would 
be interesting.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you know what a lecture is?”</span> said she.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not exactly,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, I should explain 
to you about playthings,—the various kinds, their use, the way to keep 
them, and to derive the most pleasure from them, &amp;c. Giving you <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span>this information will not be as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">interesting</span></span> to you as to hear a story; but it will be more <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">useful</span></span>, if you attend carefully, and endeavor to remember what I say.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The boys thought they should like the lecture, 
and promised to attend. Rollo said he would remember it all; and so his 
mother began.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“The value of a plaything does not consist in itself, but in the pleasure it awakens in your mind. Do you understand that?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not very well,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“If you should give a 
round stick to a baby on the floor, and let him strike the floor with 
it, he would be pleased. You would see by his looks that it gave him 
great pleasure. Now, where would this pleasure be,—in the stick, or in 
the floor, or in the baby?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, in the baby,”</span> said Rollo, laughing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes; and would it be in his body, or in his mind?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“In his face,”</span> said James.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“In his eyes,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“You would see the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">signs of it</span></span> in his face and in his eyes, but the feeling of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span>pleasure
 would be in his mind. Now, I suppose you understand what I said, that 
the value of the plaything consists in the pleasure it can awaken in the
 mind.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, mother,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“There is your jumping man,”</span> said she; <span class="tei tei-q">“is that a good plaything?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“my <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">kicker</span></span>. But I don't care much about it. I don't know where it is now.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What was it?”</span> said James. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">I</span></span> never saw it.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“It was a pasteboard man,”</span> said his mother; <span class="tei tei-q">“and there was a string behind, fixed so that, by pulling it, you could make his arms and legs fly about.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“I called him my <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">kicker</span></span>.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“You liked it very much, when you first had it.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“but I don't think it is very pretty now.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“That shows what I said 
was true. When you first had it, it was new, and the sight of it gave 
you pleasure; but the pleasure consisted in the novelty and drollery of 
it, and after a little while, when you became familiar with it, it 
ceased to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span>give you 
pleasure, and then you did not value it. I found it the other day lying 
on the ground in the yard, and took it up and put it away carefully in a
 drawer.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But if the value is all gone, what good does it do to save it?”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“The value to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">you</span></span>
 is gone, because you have become familiar with it, and so it has lost 
its power to awaken feelings of pleasure in you. But it has still power 
to give pleasure to other children, who have not seen it, and I kept it 
for them.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I should like to see it, very much,”</span> said James. <span class="tei tei-q">“I never saw such a one.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I will show it to you some time. Now, this is one kind of plaything,—those which please by their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">novelty</span></span>
 only. It is not generally best to buy such playthings, for you very 
soon get familiar with them, and then they cease to give you pleasure, 
and are almost worthless.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Only we ought to keep them, if we have them, to show to other boys,”</span> said Rollo.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said his mother. <span class="tei tei-q">“You ought never to throw them away, or leave them on the floor, or on the ground.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“O, the little fool,”</span> said Rollo suddenly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span>His
 mother and James looked up, wondering what Rollo meant. He was looking 
out at the side of the carryall, at something about the wheel.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“What is it,”</span> said his mother.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, here is a large fly trying to light on the wheel, and every time his legs touch it, it knocks them away. See! See!”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, but you must not attend to him now. You must listen to my lecture. You promised to give your attention to me.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So James and Rollo turned away from the window, and began to listen again.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I have told you now,”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“of one kind of playthings—those that give pleasure from their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">novelty</span></span> only. There is another kind—those that give you pleasure by their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">use</span></span>;—such as a doll, for example.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“How, mother? Is a doll of any <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">use</span></span>?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, in one sense; that is, the girl who has it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">uses</span></span> it continually. Perhaps she admired the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">looks</span></span> of it, the first day it was given to her; but then, after that, she can <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">use</span></span> it in so many ways, that it continues to afford her pleasure for a long time. She can dress and undress it, put <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span>it
 to bed, make it sit up for company, and do a great many other things 
with it. When she gets tired of playing with it one day, she puts it 
away, and the next day she thinks of something new to do with it, which 
she never thought of before. Now, which should you think the pleasure 
you should obtain from a ball, would arise from, its <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">novelty</span></span>, or its <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">use</span></span>?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Its <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">use</span></span>,”</span> said the boys.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said the mother. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
 first sight of a ball would not give you any very special pleasure. Its
 value would consist in the pleasure you would take in playing with it.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, it is generally 
best to buy such playthings as you can use a great many times, and in a 
great many ways; such as a top, a ball, a knife, a wheelbarrow. But 
things that please you only by their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">novelty</span></span>,
 will soon lose all their power to give you pleasure, and be good for 
nothing to you. Such, for instance, as jumping men, and witches, and 
funny little images. Children are very often deceived in buying their 
playthings; for those things which please by their novelty only, usually
 please them very much for a few minutes, while they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span>are
 in the shop, and see them for the first time; while those things which 
would last a long time, do not give them much pleasure at first.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“There is another kind 
of playthings I want to tell you about a little, and then my lecture 
will be done. I mean playthings which give <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">you</span></span> pleasure, but give <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">other persons</span></span>
 pain. A drum and a whistle, for example, are disagreeable to other 
persons; and children, therefore, ought not to choose them, unless they 
have a place to go to, to play with them, which will be out of hearing. I
 have known boys to buy masks to frighten other children with, and bows 
and arrows, which sometimes are the means of putting out children's 
eyes. So you must consider, when you are choosing playthings, first, 
whether the pleasure they will give you will be from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">novelty</span></span> or the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">use</span></span>; and, secondly, whether, in giving <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">you</span></span> pleasure, they will give <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">any other persons</span></span> pain.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“This is the end of the lecture. Now you may rest a little, and look about, and then I will tell you a short story.”</span></p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">The Young Drivers.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">They came, about this time, to the foot of a 
long hill, and Jonas said he believed that he would get out and walk up,
 and he said James might drive the horse. So he put the reins into 
James's hands, and jumped out. Rollo climbed over the seat, and sat by 
his side. Presently James saw a large stone in the road, and he asked 
Rollo to see how well he could drive round it; for as the horse was 
going, he would have carried one wheel directly over it. So he pulled 
one of the reins, and turned the horse away; but he contrived to turn 
him out just far enough to make the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="c19">other</span></span>
 wheel go over the stone. Rollo laughed, and asked him to let him try 
the next time; and James gave him the reins; but there was no other 
stone till they got up to the top of the hill.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Then James said that Rollo might ride on the 
front seat now, and when Jonas got in, he climbed back to the back seat,
 and took his place by the side of Rollo's mother.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Come, mother,”</span> then said Rollo, <span class="tei tei-q">“we <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span>are rested enough now: please to begin the story.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Very well, if you are all ready.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">So she began as follows:—</p>
<div class="block tei tei-div c28">
<h3 class="tei tei-head c25"><span class="c24">The Story of Shallow, Selfish, and Wise.</span></h3>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="c26">Once there were three boys 
going into town to buy some playthings: their names were Shallow, 
Selfish, and Wise. Each had half a dollar. Shallow carried his in his 
hand, tossing it up in the air, and catching it, as he went along. 
Selfish kept teasing his mother to give him some more money: half a 
dollar, he said, was not enough. Wise walked along quietly, with his 
cash safe in his pocket.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="c26">Presently Shallow missed 
catching his half dollar, and—chink—it went, on the sidewalk, and it 
rolled along down into a crack under a building. Then he began to cry. 
Selfish stood by, holding his own money tight in his hands, and said he 
did not pity Shallow at all; it was good enough for him; he had no 
business to be tossing it up. Wise came up, and tried to get the money 
out with a stick, but he could not. He told Shallow not to cry; said he 
was sorry he had lost his money, and that he would give him half of his,
 as soon as they could get it changed at the shop.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="c26">So they walked along to the toy-shop.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="c26">Their mother said that each one might choose his own plaything; so they began to look around on the counter and shelves.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><span class="c26">After
 a while, Shallow began to laugh very loud and heartily at something he 
found. It was an image of a grinning monkey. It looked very droll 
indeed. Shallow asked Wise to come and see. Wise laughed at it too, but 
said he should not want to buy it, as he thought he should soon get 
tired of laughing at any thing, if it was ever so droll.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="c26">Shallow was sure that he 
should never get tired of laughing at so very droll a thing as the 
grinning monkey; and he decided to buy it, if Wise would give him half 
of his money; and so Wise did.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="c26">Selfish found a rattle, a large, noisy rattle, and went to springing it until they were all tired of hearing the noise.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="tei tei-q"><span class="c26">“</span><span class="c26">I think I shall buy this,</span><span class="c26">”</span></span> <span class="c26">said he.</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span class="c26">“</span><span class="c26">I can make believe that there is a fire, and can run about springing my rattle, and crying,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span class="c26">‘</span><span class="c26">Fire! Fire!</span><span class="c26">’</span></span> <span class="c26">or I can play that a thief is breaking into a store, and can rattle my rattle at him, and call out,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span class="c26">‘</span><span class="c26">Stop thief!</span><span class="c26">’</span></span><span class="c26"> ”</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="tei tei-q"><span class="c26">“</span><span class="c26">But that will disturb all the people in the house,</span><span class="c26">”</span></span> <span class="c26">said Wise.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="tei tei-q"><span class="c26">“</span><span class="c26">What care I for that?</span><span class="c26">”</span></span> <span class="c26">said Selfish.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="c26">Selfish found that the price 
of his rattle was not so much as the half dollar; so he laid out the 
rest of it in cake, and sat down on a box, and began to eat it.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="c26">Wise passed by all the images
 and gaudy toys, only good to look at a few times, and chose a soft 
ball, and finding that that did not take all of his half of the money, 
he purchased a little morocco box with an inkstand, some wafers, and one
 or two</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><span class="c26">short
 pens in it. Shallow told him that was not a plaything; it was only fit 
for a school; and as to his ball, he did not think much of that.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="c26">Wise said he thought they 
could all play with the ball a great many times, and he thought, too, 
that he should like his little inkstand rainy days and winter evenings.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="c26">So the boys walked along 
home. Shallow stopped every moment to laugh at his monkey, and Selfish 
to spring his rattle; and they looked with contempt on Wise's ball, 
which he carried quietly in one hand, and his box done up in brown paper
 in the other.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="c26">When they got home, Shallow 
ran in to show his monkey. The people smiled a little, but did not take 
much notice of it; and, in fact, it did not look half so funny, even to 
himself, as it did in the shop. In a short time, it did not make him 
laugh at all, and then he was vexed and angry with it. He said he meant 
to go and throw the ugly old baboon away; he was tired of seeing that 
same old grin on his face all the time. So he went and threw it over the
 wall.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="c26">Selfish ate his cake up, on 
his way home. He would not give his brothers any, for he said they had 
had their money as well as he. When he got home, he went about the 
house, up and down, through parlor and chamber, kitchen and shed, 
springing his rattle, and calling out,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span class="c26">“</span><span class="c26">Stop thief! Stop thief!</span><span class="c26">”</span></span> <span class="c26">or</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span class="c26">“</span><span class="c26">Fire! Fire!</span><span class="c26">”</span></span> <span class="c26">Every body got tired, and asked him to be still; but he did not</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><span class="c26">mind, until, at last, his father took his rattle away from him, and put it up on a high shelf.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="c26">Then Selfish and Shallow went
 out and found Wise playing beautifully with his ball in the yard; and 
he invited them to play with him. They would toss it up against the 
wall, and learn to catch it when it came down; and then they made some 
bat-sticks, and knocked it back and forth to one another, about the 
yard. The more they played with the ball, the more they liked it, and, 
as Wise was always very careful not to play near any holes, and to put 
it away safe when he had done with it, he kept it a long time, and gave 
them pleasure a great many times all summer long.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="c26">And then his inkstand box was
 a great treasure. He would get it out in the long winter evenings, and 
lend Selfish and Shallow, each, one of his pens; and they would all sit 
at the table, and make pictures, and write little letters, and seal them
 with small bits of the wafers. In fact, Wise kept his inkstand box safe
 till he grew up to be a man.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c27"><span class="c26">That is the end of the story.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tei tei-div c23">
<a id="toc105"></a> <a id="pdf106"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head c22"><span class="c21">The Toy-Shop.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wish I could get an inkstand box,”</span> said Rollo, when the story was finished.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“I think he was very foolish to throw away his grinning monkey,”</span> said James, <span class="tei tei-q">“I wish I could see a grinning monkey.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">They continued talking about this story some 
time, and at length they drew nigh to the city. They drove to a stable, 
where Jonas had the horse put up, and then they all walked on in search 
of a toy-shop.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">They passed along through one or two streets, 
walking very slowly, so that the boys might look at the pictures and 
curious things in the shop windows. At length they came to a toy-shop, 
and all went in.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">They saw at once a great number and variety of 
playthings exhibited to view. All around the floor were arranged horses 
on wheels, little carts, wagons, and baskets. The counter had a great 
variety of images and figures,—birds that would peep, and dogs that 
would bark, and drummers that would drum—all by just turning a little 
handle. Then the shelves and the window were filled with all sorts of 
boxes, and whips, and puzzles, and tea-sets, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span>dolls,
 dressed and not dressed. There were bows and arrows, and darts, and 
jumping ropes, and glass dogs, and little rocking-horses, and a thousand
 other things.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">When the boys first came in, there was a little 
girl standing by the counter with a small slate in her hand. She looked 
like a poor girl, though she was neat and tidy in her dress. She was 
talking with the shopman about the slate.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don't you think,”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“you could let me have it for ten cents?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I could not afford it for less than fifteen. It cost me more than ten.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">The little girl laid the slate down, and looked 
disappointed and sad. Rollo's mother came up to her, took up the slate, 
and said,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“I should think you had better give him fifteen cents. It is a very good slate. It is worth as much as that, certainly.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, madam, so I tell her,”</span> said the shopman.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-q">“But I have not got but ten cents,”</span> said the little girl.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><span class="tei tei-q">“Have not you?”</span> said Rollo's mother. She stood still thinking a moment, and then she asked the little girl what her name was.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">She said it was Maria.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">She asked her what she wanted the slate for; and
 Maria said it was to do sums on, at school. She wanted to study 
arithmetic, and could not do so without a slate.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Jonas then came forward, and said that he should
 like to give her five cents of Georgie's money, and that, with the ten 
she had, would be enough. He said that Georgie had given him authority 
to do what he thought best with his money, and he knew, if Georgie was 
here, he would wish to help the little girl.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">Rollo and James were both sorry they had not 
thought of it themselves; and, as soon as Jonas mentioned it, they 
wanted to give some of their money to the girl; but Jonas said he knew 
that Georgie would prefer to do it. At last, however, it was agreed that
 Rollo and James should furnish one cent each, and Georgie the rest. 
This was all agreed upon after a low <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span>conversation
 by themselves in a corner of the store; and then Jonas came forward, 
and told the shopman that they were going to pay the additional five 
cents, and that he might let the girl have the slate. So Jonas paid the 
money, and it was agreed that Rollo and James should pay him back their 
share, when they got their money changed. The boys were very much 
pleased to see the little girl go away so happy with her slate in her 
hand. It was neatly done up in paper, with two pencils which the shopman
 gave her, done up inside.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">After Maria was gone, the boys looked around the
 shop, but could not find any thing which exactly pleased them; or at 
least they could not find any thing which pleased them so much more than
 any thing else, that they could decide in favor of it. So they 
concluded to walk along, and look at another shop.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">They succeeded at last in finding some 
playthings that they liked, and Jonas bought a variety of useful things 
for Georgie. On their way home, the carryall stopped at the house where 
Lucy lived <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span>and Rollo's mother left him and James there, to show Lucy their playthings.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c6">One of the things they bought was a little boat 
with two sails, and they went down behind the house to sail it. The 
other playthings and books they carried down too, and had a fine time 
playing with them, with Lucy and another little girl who was visiting 
her that afternoon.</p>

<div class="c2">1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It 
may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by 
people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a
 few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing, 
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all
 references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that 
you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting free access
 to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™ works in 
compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project 
Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily comply with the
 terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with

 laws of the country where you are located before using this eBook.</div>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="c2">1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic 
work is derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
 contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the 
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in

Gutenberg™ License.</div>
<div class="c2">1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in 
any binary, compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form,

 access to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
 other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official 
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website 
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to 
the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of 
obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain 
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the full
 Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</div>
<div class="c2">1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, 
displaying, performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ 
works unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</div>

providing access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works 
provided that:</div>
<div class="c37">
<div class="c36">• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you
 derive from the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the 
method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is 
owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has agreed
 to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg 
Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid within 60 
days following each date on which you prepare (or are legally required 
to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty payments should be 
clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4, “Information 
about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.”</div>
<div class="c36">• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user
 who notifies you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt 
that s/he does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™ 
License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of
 the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and
 all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™ works.</div>
<div class="c36">• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a 
full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a 
defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 
90 days of receipt of the work.</div>
<div class="c36">• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.</div>

writing from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the 
manager of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as 
set forth in Section 3 below.</div>
<div class="c2">1.F.</div>
<div class="c2">1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend
 considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe 
and proofread works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the 
Project Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
 electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may 
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate 
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a 
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your 
equipment.</div>
<div class="c2">1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except 
for the “Right of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, 
the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the 
Project Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
 Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability
 to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE
 THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF 
WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.
 YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR
 UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, 
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE
 NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</div>

discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving 
it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by

If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the 
medium with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided
 you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in 
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or
 entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity 
to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second 
copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without 
further opportunities to fix the problem.</div>
<div class="c2">1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or 
refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 
‘AS-IS’, WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,

<div class="c2">1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain 
implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of 
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement 
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the 
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or 
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or 
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the 
remaining provisions.</div>
<div class="c2">1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the 
Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the 
Foundation, anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, 
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the 
following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or 
any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions 
or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any Defect you 
cause.</div>
<div class="c35">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</div>
<div class="c2">Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free 
distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest 
variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new 
computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers 
and donations from people in all walks of life.</div>
<div class="c2">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers 
with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project 
Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection 
will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the 
Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a 
secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future 
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive 
Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 
and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</div>
<div class="c35">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</div>
<div class="c2">The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a 
non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of
 the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal 
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification 
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by 
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.</div>
<div class="c2">The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North
 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact 
links and up to date contact information can be found at the 
Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</div>
<div class="c35">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</div>
<div class="c2">Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive 
without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission
 of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can 
be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest 
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations 
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt 
status with the IRS.</div>
<div class="c2">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws 
regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the 
United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a 
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up 
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where 
we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND 
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
 visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</div>
<div class="c2">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from 
states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of 
no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in 
such states who approach us with offers to donate.</div>
<div class="c2">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we 
cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations 
received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small
 staff.</div>
<div class="c2">Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current
 donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of 
other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. 
To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</div>
<div class="c35">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</div>
<div class="c2">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the 
Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could 
be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and 
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of 
volunteer support.</div>
<div class="c2">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several
 printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by 
copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do
 not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper 
edition.</div>
<div class="c2">Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>.</div>
<div class="c2">This website includes information about Project 
Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg 
Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how
 to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</div>
